Prof. Prvulovic's explanations left very little doubt on almost all the topics he covered in the lectures. I have them all downloaded & can keep going back for reference. Although a more active participation on piazza would have made the learning experience even better. But, having gone to a college here in the US for my masters' I know it's almost not possible to get full attention of a Prof all the time... \nPerhaps some homework assignments would have helped improve the understanding even better (& helped in the midterms :)). The projects were interesting and were useful in applying what we learn in the classes. There were lot of complaints about the SESC simulator code in general. Its very understandable that the code is in that state having changed so many hands. Don't have much to complaint about this course in general. \nOverall experience with the course has been very satisfying.",

IOS was a good basis when you're not already familiar with C and systems programming. \nEvery lecture walks students through a single paper, explaining the concepts and adding historical, academical context. The selection of papers is very good, it's a journey through landmark ideas in systems research. Reading all the papers was impossible for me with a day job and hobbies. I resorted to reading the abstract and summaries (provided by peres as part of course requirements) for about three quarters of the material. \nThe grading of projects and exams seems fair and forgiving. \nThe projects are tough and require recognizing challenges and coming up with your own designs for them. Also you have to write your own test code, which can be a substantial part of the project. It is always recommended to start working on the project 2-3 weeks in advance to be able to ask questions on Piazza and also just to sleep over it and find solutions to problems. They are definitely not \"just doing the exercise\". \nThe course requires a bit of investment, but offers tremendous learning opportunity. I was also constantly drifting off into the subjects covered while browsing through Wikipedia, research papers and technical manuals. ",

            "text": "The lectures were thought by Dr. Goel, but the primary instructor was David Joyner. These notes are copy & pasted from the Piazza forum of the course. \n\nI did not like this course very much. Disliked the flow of the lectures, had a hard time following what Dr. Goel tried to explain and could not relate lecture content to the projects really. Has been the most frustrating class so far in my curriculum. I really liked the organization and effort that went into the interactive exercises, the overall communication, grading and the friendly frequent contact. David's been a great instructor. \n\nThe whole educational strategy of this course is brilliant. I would love seeing it applied to other courses. \n\nI can appreciate how the KBAI class falls into the \"academic-style thought\" bucket. I admit, I might have approached the class from a wrong angle, even though it said so right on the labelling. \n\nBut then I doubt the validity of your airplane analogy. Of course the airplane project would not touch upon every subject, but conversely the lectures should instruct how to actually design such a plane. Or at least point to the right resources, tutorials or books. I just thought it would not hurt to slide in a lecture or two that examines the design and implementation of a couple of cool and interesting classic or modern AI agents (maybe a simple one right in the first week to illustrate what we're talking about, a more complex one in the middle and an advanced one at the end). I would argue it would strengthen the understanding of the high level concepts being thought. ",

            "text": "This was my first class in the OMSCS program and by far this was the best class I have taken during my formal CS education. I did get an A in the course for some perspective. The course is made up of 4 projects, a midterm, final, and class participation on Piazza. The lectures are great and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching them on at least 1. 25x speed. I started doing this halfway through the semester (eventually bumped up to 1. 5x when re-watching) and realized I could retain a lot more info than having to keep rewinding because my mind was drifting. Only a handful of papers to read, most were pretty dated but helped drive some concepts home. If you are looking for an easy class though, this is not for you. I feel this has prepared me well for the workload/work ethic necessary to succeed in classes to come. You get out what you put in!\n\nAlso 'Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces' is a free online book that I referenced A LOT to give me an intro into the topics discussed in the lectures. Chapters are short and easy to read/comprehend. Highly recommend it!\n\nFull Details:\nThe projects are, as mentioned everywhere else, difficult and clarification of parts are necessary. I would recommend being comfortable with at least the basics of C (pointers, func pointers, extern usage, getopts, string parsing, file manipulation, etc. ). For some that might be too basic but if you know how to read through the provided code then you should be okay to at least get through the simpler portions of the projects. You will want to start looking into the basics of socket communication, posix threading library, posix/sysv IPC mechanisms and synchronization. You will be provided enough material to get you going with each of the items listed in the last sentence. \n\nThe midterm and final are not easy and it is not enough to \"memorize\" formulas/concepts. You will need to understand the purpose and how each input to the problems/equations affect the output and then formulate what pieces are necessary to come to the correct answer. You will really have to understand the material. That said it is possible to do well. Participating in Piazza discussions, re-watching lectures, and doing the projects will prepare you well in understanding the concepts/problems on the exam. \n\nOne thing you might not expect is that you are provided an Ubuntu VM that is set up to test your projects in before trying the auto-grader in Udacity. Valgrind and GDB will be your best friend and help you find things that the auto-grader will detect and fail your submission even though things in the VM work fine. I would recommend some sort of version control too (I used git)!",

First project took a bit of time to learn about how to use gdb and machine code in general. Preparing for midterm now, which coveres 10 chapters. \nThe second project was a bit annoying to get the VM set up. I was sure I ran the malware analysis correctly, but don't think the results were coming out correctly. I got a new laptop after this project to ensure that I would not have any technical issues for the remainder of my OMSCS life. Project 4 and optional project 4. 5 were easy because I am familiar with JS and SQL. Project 3 was buggy, and the instructor recognized that stating that he will address that in future courses. \nI missed a bunch of quizzes because of poor time management, but still ended up with an A in the course. Overall the class touches upon many interesting topics and is a good second course to take with something more intense, such as ML. ",

It is very poor at teaching you Machine Learning efficiently compared to the numerous other offerings on Coursera. \n\nDon't expect to understand the material presented. That apparently isn't the goal of the course because the instructors spend their time hand-waving and the assignments have you spend time debugging against shoddy tools. You won't learn to troubleshoot the thought process or algorithms, just to fiddle at the margins with the tools provided. The people who give this course favorable reviews are very strong coders but very weak on theory and math; they pull through because they can plug & chug the coding assignments and use the crappy tools. Based on other reviews, many students thought the math in this course was challenging. It is basic freshman/sophomore calculus, but a lot of people didn't come into this program with that. If you consider yourself a math person, take Andrew Ng's classes on Stanford Engineering Everywhere. That's what real Machine Learning looks like, not the plug-and-chug coding of this course. \n\nIn this course you will get a lot of practice running algorithms that are poorly explained. I have a math / physics background and am floored by how superficial -- yet still time-consuming -- the total coverage, problem sets, and exams were. The questions involve running algorithms and interpreting output, which is about as crank-turning as I could imagine. Still, it takes a lot of time to do because the tools (except Weka) are weak and the lectures exceedingly hand-wavy. I found the book much more clear (though dry) in its explanations than the lectures. Neither were helpful on any of the assignments. Basically if you're modestly good at Java (or expertly good with Python and R ML libraries) and have a lot of time to learn to use APIs for existing ML tools, then you're fine. Perhaps that's what all CS courses are like?",

I guess it is how you make of it. The course gives you many opportunities to learn more advanced techniques, but you can complete the course satisfactorily (I guess) without doing so. \n Throughout the lectures and the problem sets, it feels like you are being assisted like a 5 year-old: everything is well explained, you wouldn't notice much if you do not have a good grip. The problem sets are scored as all or nothing, but the answers are also provided so it seems to be just a matter of having tried or not tried. If you want to get more advanced, materials for advanced study are also provided, but it would not really hurt if you do not glance over them. It is easy to get complacent, until you get to the Runaway Robot and the Final Project, which are really challenging. You really needed to take a big leap, read a lot more and explore other possible algorithms to solve the problem. Most of my classmates talk about using an algorithm not even discussed in the lectures for solving the Final Project. \n\n The TAs are very helpful. They do their best to up the participation, even create interesting videos every week. When somebody asks questions, they are quick to dive in. And when they do, they do not just answer: they give expounded explanations like how things might be different for other cases.

When the professor designed the course, I doubt he realized how time-consuming it would actually be. \n\nIt took me 2-2. 5x as much time as Machine Learning (7641) did. As mentioned below, the time-spent-to-amount-learned ratio is not very good. I probably spent about 5% of the time actually learning and 95% of the time hacking away / throwing everything against the wall to get something to work. Many classmates had similar feelings. \n\nOne of the (4) homeworks took me about 12 hours just to get the very first part correct - worth 5 points; and that step was necessary to move on with the rest of the assignment. On another assignment I was stuck on the first section for an entire week and spent around 30 hours trying to figure out what was wrong. The students on Piazza and the TAs are helpful, but when you are truly stuck, too bad - you'll get a bad grade. What's worse is that the TAs don't share the correct solutions with you afterwards. Because of this, I feel like there's a lot I didn't take away from the class. \n\nThe class frequently has guest lecturers, which seem extremely interesting. Unfortunately, the instructors never shared any of the videos past March 1st, so the majority of talks were never shared with OMSCS students. Students asked about this on Piazza (several times) with no response from the teaching team. \n\nThe final project is enjoyable, but my mentor didn't make things easy. For the project, my mentor was supposed to upload a large. csv file to a Postgres database, but 2 days before the due date he still couldn't get it working -- which led to me having to re-write a significant portion of my code. I spent about 20 hours debugging this, but still couldn't get it working - because of that, I was forced to use a smaller dataset (which I'll be punished for). \n\nThis course has a lot of potential, but desperately needs to be re-designed and have the professor more actively involved.

Another downside of the heavy workload that the TAs can't always keep up the pace either, some assignments took quite long to return and we had to submit at least 3 assignments before we got our first feedback.

The last of the three projects is implementation, and it feels like busywork. \n\nOverall, kudos to Dr. Mark and the TA's. This course was interesting, well-run, and not too difficult. ",

He and the TAs are insanely responsive and always have a nice mix of hints & wit in their replies. \n\nThe assignments start off pretty simple and ramp up near the end. The third section can be challenging but very satisfying to see things working. The lectures are really wonderful, and the textbooks are also fantastic, which is something I rarely say. \n\nMy sole complaint is a big one: the mid-term. Essentially the class compiles a list of questions for the mid-term, which culminates into a 700-question bucket. Those who did well largely memorized as much of this as possible. It seemed like a large amount of busy work and taking exams based on memorization is a pretty crummy way to spend a Sunday. \n\nSo prepare for a really great, fun course with one bummer in the middle.

The projects were cool and interesting(know your Python), once you figured out how to get started. That might be my one recommendation is that sometimes we really had no idea how to get started. They definitely expect the \"figuring it out\" part is the first step of each project and is crucial to understanding. The autograders were a bit scary, cause even when you got the project working, you were worried whether your project would pass or not. Our last project has an autograder we had access to, so we knew for sure. Hopefully that will become the norm. My advice, the projects are very doable if you start early. Those who waited really seemed to panic at the end. TA (esp Michael) were extremely communicative in Piazza, so use that site daily for questions and updated. The course looks like they are redesigning, so there is definitely some re-ordering that needs to be done between readings, quizzes, and projects.

I felt like I was being penalized not because of my understanding, but because of some weird artificial limitation. After this, rather than trying to explain my solution, I wrote down shorter jargon filled answers that, truthfully, I sometimes didn't fully understand and ended up getting full credit.

Seeing the output of an algorithm that you implemented to track a hand in a video for example, that's just awesome. \n\nThe time requirement is very real. The 2nd project, which turned about to be the longest, took me about 60 hours to complete. The math and linear algebra can be intimidating, and if it wasn't for the community on Piazza I don't think I would have figured out how to do certain things. As difficult as it is, the grading is very honest and the TAs are extremely helpful - if you put in the effort you will succeed. \n\nThis is a very challenging course but it is 100% worth it.

I think a better understanding of numpy and \"vectorization\" in particular would have saved me a ton of headache in the first half of the course. Also, I did not do this, but I wish I had taken Computational Photography first. There were a few posts on Piazza about how much that helped. ",

Not the most interesting material to read through but it is scientific papers so be prepared to read papers several times. I think on average there were 3-4 papers per week. The first project seemed reasonable but a lot like the projects in IOS (which I took Fall 2015 and did very well in). You will fight with the autograder a lot and instructions were fairly vague. Good help from Piazza though. \n\nFrom looking ahead before I dropped there is A LOT of material you are tested on in the midterm/final study guides that comes directly from the papers. This might be the reason that the test grades are so low. \n\nI was excited to take the course but after spending just over a month in the course I'm glad I dropped it. Definitely information overload from the papers and trying to digest those left me exhausted when tackling the project.

If the exam questions were more straightforward, I would be happier with this class overall. Do not try to cheat your way through this class. He will run your code through a plagarism detection system (MOSS). I didn't cheat, but it still stressed me out a lot that there were announcements saying people who cheated should confess or be reported to the dean. I would always worry that the system might flag my submission as a false positive when it was analyzed. This is probably the second most stressful class I've taken in the program.

As a computer scientist you can expect pretty much every job interview to include algorithmic questions. This class will not prepare you at all for it. You spend most of the time figuring out how to encode Turing machines or theorizing about esoteric mathematical graph properties, both of very little use for computer scientists. The instructor really didn't do much throughout the entire class. His attitude is either you already know the material and you'll pass, or if you don't he can't really teach it to you. The lectures (prepared by another instructor) don't really give you the background needed to solve the homework or the exams as set by the current instructor. You mostly have to make up your own curriculum and hope that what you studied gives you the math background needed to barely pass this class. I don't recommend taking this class until they change the current instructor or he changes the way it's taught. When half the class drops by the withdrawal date and the remaining half gets a C or lower, you're really not teaching anything and you actually didn't do your job as an instructor, in my opinion. ",

However, this will probably be my lowest grade at GA Tech, because their grading rubric and assignment weights are absolutely asinine. They would deduct huge amounts of points for trivial, ridiculous, or even subjective reasons. \n\nThey would also derive requirements from posts between students, or from optional office hours (note: there was a special requirements interview office hours, and I'm not referring to that one) and then grade against those arbitrary requirements, which I found to be rather uncalled for and unbelievable. \n\nThere's a lot of group work, and every week some project or assignment will be due, so the workload is very consistent, you will be putting in hours towards this class every single week for the full semester. Take this into account if you have a lot of business trips or plan to take any additional courses while taking this one. \n\nFor the good:\nThe lecture videos are some of the best I've seen at GA Tech and the android application development was really fun, plus there were consistent office hours on google hangouts every week.

            "text": "Unlike some others who have stated this class was super easy, I will contrast and state I thought it was very challenging. I would not consider it hard, but it was very time consuming, especially toward the end. The first several weeks are no more than a few hours week. After the midterm, the projects get very difficult and toward the end, I was spending upward of 40 hours a week working on them. The first few assignments are very much 'hand holding' to give you direction. The last few are much more like real world programming assignments where you are given a task without much direction and have to figure out how to do it. Expect to spend lots of time Googling. \n\nThe first half of the class was easy as it slowly allowed you piece by piece to assemble the final projects. The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week. \n\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch's book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, 'IBM']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam. \n\nOverall I really did like the class. I have an interest in the stock market, so the material was right up my alley. If you find finance boring you will likely not get as much out of it. Make sure you have at least intermediate level Python skills. Brush up on Numpy and Pandas before taking the class and you will do well. ",

Although the instructor says all the quiz answers can be derived from the slides, I think some of that is a far stretch. I feel it is easier to personally fill in the gaps through reading the textbook. \n- Projects were enjoyable and challenging. There were four in total. The third was a new one in this semester that had a lot of technical issues and bugs. I don't think it was an appropriate project to ask students to test out a smartphone app. Fortunately, there was an alternative option for that project (which was a literature project and designing a smartphone app that uses pki). \n- Bonus extra credit was available if you complete additional problems related to a project. \n- Exams were fair. Multiple choice and T/F on proctortrack. \n- Professors and TAs were helpful. They even held office hours almost everyday in the week!

If you're not comfortable with matrices and their operations some of the projects will be difficult. Projects 2 (hough), 6 (optical flow), and 7 (particle filters) were the most challenging and time consuming. The final was open book/notes and covered all sections of the lecture. It wasn't difficult if you covered all of the lectures and mostly stuck to higher level questions than minutiae. The one thing I really disliked about this class, and computer vision in general, is the parameter tuning/fitting. One will spend a lot of time doing that for the projects in this class to make things work. The most difficult thing for me was keeping up with the lecture/notes while also doing the projects.

I felt that the two person teaching format worked really well for the course, to the point where I started to question why all courses didn't do this. It sort of reminded me of the back and forth in a RadioLab podcast. This was one of the best classes I've ever taken, and even though I have some background in Machine Learning, I felt I took away a lot of new insights from this course. \n\nIs it hard? I guess. I don't feel that it's hard to get a \"B\", but you have to work at it. I think the professor recognizes your efforts and as long as you are committed to learning the material (proving it by doing all the assignments and problem sets), then you should get at least a B. Another way to put it is that if you didn't get a B in this class, you probably weren't that surprised about it. \n\nIn terms of criticisms, this was my first course in OMSCS, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Certainly there seems to be a fair amount of growing pains in the program itself when it comes to addressing student concerns or giving out grades on time. But it also seems that the administrators recognize this and actively try to improve the environment for everyone. Over time I think some of these hiccups will iron itself out. A second criticism is that the book they recommend is a bit antiquated, given the level to which this field has evolved. It would have been nice if they upgraded to ESL or something similar. \n\nOverall though, I'm very happy that I took this course. ",

The projects definitely ramped up as the class went on but I really liked how the professor made each project build on top of each other. As long as you stay on top of your projects, build out your projects modularly, comment your code well, and don't overly procrastinate this class should be relatively straightforward.

Congratulations!\n \nAny feedback without mentioning the lecture videos would, to me, be unfair. For ML videos to be not boring is a monumental task, but I, and I think remaining class shares this sentiment, rather enjoyed them and would listen to them in extended sessions. So, Congatulations on that too!\n \nThe assignments about 80/85% of the time are well managed and well explained, with a clear rubric set for students to meet. In comparison to other better-managed classes, I'd rate this aspect of the class up there with the best. \n \nOn the improvement side, I'd personally like to see following:\nMid-term question creation should be replaced with better directed assignments/projects. I didn't see any value in them. Sorry :(\nSome might not agree with me, but I think first mini-course should be left for students to explore. I'd rather start with Mini Course 2 and ML part immediately afterwards\nRight now, the course gives a touch of ML for Trading systems. I think this leaves room for more \"in-class\" experimentation. Perhaps more algorithms, ideas etc... I'd rank this course from easy-to-medium difficulty; but, I think it should be, with some more directed effort towards ML and its experimentation with Trading systems, medium-to-high difficulty range. \nLecture videos are so good that I would love to see more of them. Other ML algorithms, their analysis etc... Perhaps students don't have to be assigned tasks from them if it becomes too much, but still they can always see them and learn from them in their free time. \n \nI have had great fun with this course, and I hope everyone else has too.

I'd even go as far as to say that this course actually prepared me for a separate assignment in another course which helped me apply what I was learning while taking this one. As a qualification, I am of the student build that didn't come with a complete CS background, instead having a degree in IT with an emphasis in programming. However at time of taking this course I have never taken a traditional algorithm and data structure course which the class expects you to come with some knowledge. \n\nThe course surveys different testing tools and ways of deriving analysis. It requires a lot of exploration and research on the student's part which I think is largely why there are many negative reviews because in many instances you were stuck reading through pages of a specific API in order to complete one part of the assignment. For me at least I can say that this has largely made me a better programmer though it feels like a trial by fire. We had a pretty active piazza environment so I was able to make some pretty good strides. However, be aware that the instructor is a stickler for plagiarism, so absolutely it is to your benefit to write your own code by yourself. \n\nThe tests are open book, but it doesn't really help because it will be based more on your ability to apply the knowledge to problems. \n\nClosing statements, this was the first iteration of the course online so there were a couple of speed bumps. I expect that the course will get better with time. ",

I don't come from a CS background and took this course mostly for curiosity and the fun of puzzle solving. It's eye opening to see so many techniques, each with their own benefits and trade-offs. The lectures are not the most entertaining ones, but the organization is very good and I had no trouble following through. The assignments and exams focus heavily on application of concepts and problem solving. \n\nEach assignment involves reading the documentation on your own. It sounds intimidating but once you get your hands dirty with some examples, the problems aren't impossible. You can even get away with reading minimal amount of documentation. I'm not sure if the tools you learn in the assignments will be used in your future career, but they do serve the purpose of helping you learn. You'll need some knowledge about Java and at least be able to debug pointer related errors. The exams are difficult but open notes. It involves some tricks and a lot of thinking. \n\nRegarding plagiarism, the solution as simple as \"don't do it\". There's no need to worry that your one-sentence code will most likely be the same as someone else'. The teaching staff know well enough about software testing to avoid false positives. Anti-plagiarism is not your enemy unless you are happy to graduate with students who cheat their way. ",

The course work was way out of balance, with the first half (or so) of the course having almost no work and the last half being heavily loaded. Also, I felt like the list of hundreds of questions to \"study\" for the midterm was counterproductive, as these questions were student written and just generally hard to parse. A lot of my frustration came from Pandas (a python module) which has a really annoying and backwards API and doesn't adhere to the way things are generally done in Python. Overall I spent hours and hours googling ways to do stuff in Pandas, reading piazza, pouring over the assignment docs, etc, which just somehow doesn't feel really rewarding. ",

I did not get the pleasure of having David as the TA but I hear he is equally amazing. Dr. Goel makes this an extraordinary class and really keeps one engaged. The head TA we had, Lallith, did a great job as well. There are numerous positives and I want list them all here other than to say that the positives way out weight the negatives. But will here are my two negatives. \nOne, the third project emphasizes the use of visual viewing of the images which you end up focusing on solving the problem visually instead of utilizing any AI techniques you learned in the class. People with a visual programming background have an advantage on project 3 I think. Note it shouldn't affect your grade to much just feel I spent way more time trying to understand visual programming then I did learning to apply AI techniques on project 3. \nTwo, there is alot of writing and essays. Some of the essay questions become fairly hard to apply using the items you learned in class. Alot of the AI techniques overlap and are fairly theoretical. On top of this, it is graded by a random TA. There is no secondary grader and your scores are left to the arbitrary TA who reviews it. On top of this I had in some cases great detail about why I was scored a certain way and then in others it was a single sentence. There is alot of writing and it spreads the TAs pretty thin but would be nice if a second pair of TA eyes could review a paper. Note, I am not complaining of my score they did a pretty good job but just seems a bit arbitrary. \nThe work load is pretty high and can be made higher depending how much detail you want to give. The instructor is down right amazing and enjoys challenging the students and himself. Overall I highly recommend the class and most will do fine as long as real effort is made. Grade is curved. ",

If you have recently taken something similar to CCA in your undergrad then the material in this course is not that hard. If you have been a programmer professionally for years and forgotten most of your undergrad then this course will be extremely difficult. The grading in Spring of 2016 was also very opaque and led to some unnecessary challenges. My advice for this class would be:\n\n1. Take this class alone. I am a single guy with no family and I would not want to have taken any other classes with this one. If you have any family I would highly recommend you take this class by itself. \n2. Do not ignore the pre-reqs. Make sure you satisfy all of them before you come in. \n3. This class is very mathy and proof based so be ready for that. I personally really like math and think it has its place inside a Computer Science degree from a research institution, but if you're expecting to be programming a lot you may get caught off guard. \n4. Do not take this class alone, make sure you are on a chat group with other students or very active on Piazza. \n5. Use all of the additional text books, especially if Sipser's is the main text book. I really like Algorithms by Dasgupta\n\nThis course is required for almost all of the specializations right now so you basically have to take it, but do not take it lightly.

So overall I'm on the side of leaving that part in but shortening it. \n\nI loved that professor asked to implement everything ourselves without relying to any library (other than numpy/pandas). There's nothing like implementing an algorithm yourself. Even something as simple as KNN has its tricks when implementing it. \n\nI loved that the assignments were somehow at par with the class. Every assignment is an increment over the last one. You get to build your own market simulator (or backtester). Stock trading strategies and then ML algorithms for it. \n\nProfessor was incredibly engaged throughout the class. He hosts several hangouts of an hour or more himself. He's amazingly active in piazza.

Most of the comments already here describe the experience well, so I'll concentrate on advice. \n1) Study the prereqs specified for the course, but don't expect for a moment that will get you by. Read the assigned textbook for the course (Sipser) and try, try, try to understand it before you attempt the course (yes, all of it). If you don't, you will not likely do well in this course. Use the Internet to help your understanding of the material (watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation video series). \n2) The teaching/videos in the class are terrible. Sadly, most of the stuff I found on the Internet presents the material in the exact same way. Your best bet? Find a group to work with to help you try and understand the material. And really try to understand it, because you will need to turn in homework that is based on your own thoughts. Additionally, your group will not be there to help you on the exams. \n3) Your grade is based on you and you alone. You will not get a good grade just because you did better than a certain percentage of the class. If that what you need to succeed, this class is not for you. \n4) Don't expect to ever know how you truly stand in the class. Grading (under the current grading style) is very vague and inconsistent. If the thought of this drives you crazy, stay far away. \n5) If you feel you are doing poorly in 1st half of the class, don't assume you will do better in the 2nd half. It is possible that you will. It is likely that you won't. Past [student] performance is no indication of your success [or failure]. \n6) Conversely to #5, feeling you are doing great in the 1st half is no indication of how you will do in the 2nd half. Persevere. \n7) Try out the class. It is a good experience. But don't be afraid to drop the class if you are doing poorly. There is no shame in not completing this class or switching to a specialization that doesn't require it. ",

I didn't know what I was getting into until the classes started, but quickly I realized this was going to be tough. \n\nThere's more material in this course that what you can cover without going nuts. The lessons are long and complicated, and each one comes with a bunch of scientific papers that you need to read and understand. I found the material fascinating but reading and learning the content of the papers will probably take some getting used to. \n\nThere are two exams in this class. Both are closed notes and for each one you have to understand a ton of content. The questions are not limited to single or multiple-choice which make the exams even more complicated. My class did very poorly on both exams, and we had to wait for a generous curve to pull our grades up. \n\nI scored 57 out of 100 on the first exam and an incredible 75 in the second. These, together with solid grades on all the projects, gave me all I needed to finish with an A. Participation in the class was also a big factor, so I recommend you make yourself visible as much as you can. \n\nBy the way, be ready to code a lot. The projects were amazingly interesting and complicated, and we had to code like crazy to finish them. Any previous knowledge of C will certainly help you out here, but I although my C was very rusty, I was able to pull through after some long nights. \n\nNot everyone was lucky on these projects, and a big portion of the class wasn't able to even find the solution to some of them. I'd recommend starting as soon as you get access to the project description because you'll need every minute you can get. \n\nOn this course you don't work on teams, so your success or failure is entirely on you. That being said, make sure you collaborate with everyone else in the class. That was one of the reasons I was able to finish all the projects and end up with an excellent grade.",

A lot of the material has really stuck and I have been able to apply these principles to subsequent classes. \n\nI felt this class was more time consuming than hard. It takes a more hands-on approach rather than a theoretical one. There is a lot of time spent tinkering with data-sets and runing different algorithms. But, I never felt like I did not know how to do stuff or that the material was difficult to grasp, projects just took some time to iron out and decide how you wanted to procede with them. \n\nPersonally, I would have preferred a little more of a theoretical approach and deeper dive and increased focus on the underlying math, which was extremely light. But at the same time, this is a survey course that aims to cover a lot of topics, so perhaps it is not realistic to increase the depth too much without sacrificing breadth. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this course!",

But the grading criterion for this course seems to be:\n\n\"Grade the students on everything we threw at them, knowing they couldn't possibly absorb it all, then give them all a massive curve at the end. \"\n\nThe problem with this is that there's no guided prioritization of focus. I learned tons in this class.

The course covers many OS topics with focuses on design and implementation of concurrency system, i. e. , CPU, memory, IO and file systems. I would say the course is well prepared and taught, the lecture is organized, the teachers and TAs are engaged, and the piazza discussion is very active and fun (well, it could also be discouraging, when you see your classmates are way far ahead of you into the project works). \n\nI am not sure if the project assignment is my favorite part of the course, but it is definitely where I learn the most. I am not a programmer but as a PhD in electrical engineering, I do have quite some experience in programming (not C unfortunately). However, I did have a hard time with C. This is mostlikely the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background and skill sets of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve. Most of people's feedback is \"I thought I know how to program in C until I started CS8803 Intro OS\". \n\nThe content of the course is really straightforward, i would rate the difficulty for the course content 3. However, the programming assignments are substantially more difficult for those who are not experienced with C. I rate it 4. 2. Given the fact that project assignment takes about 3 times more time than the course content, the weighted difficulty is 3. 9. \n\nThank you Ada and also the TA s for the fantastic course. ",

They are almost always available on piazza, we had office hours almost every other week etc. Prof. Vuduc is not only good at HPC but has a very good sense of humor which he mixes well in between the lectures. That kind of lightens up the sometimes heavy content. Overall the video lectures are super excellent & worth while revisiting them when needed. \nIf you are willing to work hard & learn a lot, this is a course you shouldn't miss. I would highly recommend this course. ",

What is the point of practicing without something to align yourself against? Your work is being sent off into a void. Vague homework feedback that mostly consists of \"you did the problem wrong\"? Yea, thanks. One TA grading something correct, another TA grading the same exact thing incorrect. Homeworks that consist of 3 problems that most people spend 20+ hours on... followed by exams that consist of 6 problems with only 3 hours? Right... The final exam had you calculating inverse matrices involving 1/12th fractions by hand? What is the point of that? And every single homework and exam problem demanded that you produce a solution in some exact particular format or way, yet you rarely have any glimpse into what that format or way should look like. I learned WAY more while enrolled in 6505 from simply watching video lecture material and reading PDF note packages from other non-OMSCS courses. I learned next to nothing from 6505 directly, and the entire course was an exercise in futile frustration. For comparison, I took ML... ML was a tough class, but doable if you invest the time. 6505 is something else entirely. Avoid this course at all costs. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this course is so bad too, because the material under consideration is vital to a thorough understanding of CS theory. The material in this course is what separates CS from code monkeys. This is why you're better off not taking this course, and obtaining that knowledge through other sources. ",

Know you algorithmic analysis. I found that I had to brush up on a few areas of maths during the course which didn't help under the heavy workload. Knowing some linear algebra is also helpful as 2 large sections of the course work with matrices. The assignments are mostly done in C, so make sure you're well versed with that. The level of C needed is (imho) about the same as that for AOS or similar courses. \n\nThe class is hard because achieving high performance is a difficult problem. If you do this class, you'll discover that even something simple like sorting which you may have mastered from undergrad now becomes an order of magnitude more complex and if you don't do it right you may have severely degraded performance even though you have N times more computing power. \n\nI highly recommend this class. Even if you're not solving a problem across many compute nodes, performance will always be important and this class will give you the right tools to write high performance software. ",

I tend to procrastinate and the grade on my first assignment showed that. As you work through the assignments, you'll find more and more questions that you'll try to answer. In order to have an interesting paper that fits the page limits, you must be able to explain why your experimenting showed the results that it did concisely yet comprehensively.

They were difficult, but we were given another chance to submit after they had been graded. I didn't do too bad on these, but honestly I spent too much time on them. I should have been focusing on the concepts as a whole which would have helped me on the tests which I never did too hot on. I spent forever on the HW assignment, and I never had time to do the challenge problems.

Try to keep yourself on track - for getting grade \"A\" - the margin for error is not very high. \n\nAnother plus for this course: if you have made a mistake - you can simply request your mentor (TA) to correct it. You can focus on ideas and innovation and not worry about typos and losing points. ",

Trying to learn those skills while taking this course won't work at all. To be honest, the instructor clearly explains that, and gives a fair warning on the first week of class. Trying to do that would be like trying to learn Pre-Calculus and Calculus at the same time (as someone recently mentioned). \n\nThe instructor and TA seem very involved in improving the experience for all students. New for this semester: they returned a first submission of homework with feedback, and we had a resubmission opportunity for 100% of the grade (6 homework assignments - 3 problems each). Also new this semester: the course is now divided in three sections, for each one of them there's a proctored exam (closed book, one sheet of notes - two sided). So it was easier to study than for previous terms, when there were two exams. \n\nThe exam problems were very similar to the problem sets given for each unit. There were no \"official\" solutions for the ungraded problem sets, the philosophy of the instructor is that we should work on them on our own (but collaboration in study groups was encouraged - I know there were study groups on G+ Hangouts, Slack, and locally held meetings). Working on study groups really helped. An informal statistic for a group had: 11 A's, 10 B's, 6 C's. So that really makes a difference. \n\nIt was mentioned that there will be further enhancements to this course next term. Something else: do try to take advantage of every extra credit opportunity (if given). \n\nI definitely can say that I learned A LOT. There where weeks were I spent my weekdays after office 8pm-1am, and weekends all day long reading, working on homework, watching lectures from other universities. Take advantage of the instructor/TA's! Don't be afraid of asking any question about the material, I don't remember a question left unanswered. ",

Yet, when I put my own spin on things, my grades didn't come out well. I felt like I was guessing at requirements, and was extremely uncomfortable writing my essays as a result. In the end, I had a sense of what the TAs look for (though it's hit-or-miss depending on who you get), and I wrote to that. Beware if you have a different thought than what's accepted!\nThe word count in the assignments is a lie. You need to double or triple it, add about six or seven diagrams and probably some pseudo-code. I got burned on the first reflection because it was too short and I didn't understand what they were looking for. \nThe class was hard because in a sense, the ideas were too simple. I didn't feel like I was learning anything and so I didn't even know what I could write about. \nI didn't like Dr. Goel. He didn't seem respectful of the fact that I was having difficulty understanding what the requirements were. I felt like I was guessing, and he would just disagree when I attempted an idea (but not give me any clues as to how to continue). It seemed lazy, like he didn't actually want to think about my problem--but then, why even respond?\nThe TAs were fine, and helped me out with some of the issues I had. Their feedback on my assignments was insufficient, but they actually helped me with some of my questions and seemed to care about how well my Raven's solutions were going. \nIn the end, I was disappointed and I think I may have wasted four months banging my head against the wall, trying to find meaning in a class that just doesn't have any.

            "text": "First off, the GT course surveys site currently reports this as almost as difficult as 6505. This wasn't true, at least for me. This class is tedious and time consuming, while 6505 is just plain difficult and time consuming. \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures did a good job of explaining the various machine learning algorithms. Most lectures described things relatively informally (no rigorous math or proofs). For some of the concepts, I kind of wish they had explained the math behind the algorithm a bit better, but for the most part they were very good\n\nHomework:\nThe homework is structured as four projects. There were two big issues with the homework. First, there was a sizable gulf between the material presented in the lectures and what you actually had to do for the projects. There was lots of outside reading required to understand how exactly to use the ML algorithms in an analysis setting. In other words, the lectures explained how the algorithms worked but you were on your own with the homeworks in terms of comparing them and determining which performed best and why. Second, you were kind of on your own when it came to picking tools to perform your analysis. As a beginner to these concepts, I spent lots of time evaluating machine learning frameworks to determine which best suited the assignment. This meant I was spending less time actually working with the algorithms and more time experimenting with machine learning libraries. The TAs and professor occasionally made suggestions, but it would have been nice to get a list of vetted frameworks for each project. \n\nAssembling the reports for the homework was tedious. It involves running multiple (hopefully repeatable), possibly long running experiments and usually plotting the right things for each algorithm. This was by no means _hard_, but it was time consuming. \n\nGrading/Administration\nI thought grading was generous. The homeworks were graded fairly, but it would have been nice to have a more explicit rubric. ",

There was not much help from the instructors and the Piazza forum was ran by only handful of students.

It was kind of a competition: the teaching staff often posted the top 5 performers among the submitted projects, with metrics and whatnot, so I got to try my very bestest to make it to that list. It was madness! (good madness)\nEach project illustrated a very advanced element of HPC, so I left with a feeling of having learned a lot. \n\nProf. Vuduc has a very particular sense of humor, which he embedded in his videos. It surprised me how I never got fed up with the jokes. I guess I always find a true nerd's humor amusing. \n\nI'd like to invite everyone to give HPC a chance. The fact that it's not required for a specialization (anymore :'S) shouldn't mean it's not worth the effort. This class is the bomb! It's packed with algorithm design and analysis (and very clever algorithms, by the way), several models of computation that you may not have studied before, and probably should, oh and the projects are spectacular. If you like algorithms, programming, getting your mind blown, and are up for a challenge, this class is for you. It's hands-on Computer Science in my opinion. \n\nThere are some requirements that I'll try and emphasize here:\n - Running time and complexity analysis, Big O and Theta notation, the master method, etc. \n - C and C++. You gotta know how to code in these languages. I mean know them well. If you're afraid of pointers, you should get some practice first. \n - Basic Linux command line knowledge, as projects involve a virtual machine and the Deepthought Cluster. \n - Some linear algebra, as in virtually any other class. \n - C and C++. Yes, you need to be able to get an algorithm from a lecture or an academic paper down to functional C/C++ code. \n - Debugging in the woods with your teeth and a knife. \n\nGive it a shot, You'll have fun!",

He is very active on piazza and sometimes I wondered whether he slept at all :) Piazza threads are super organized, so if when there were close to 10, 000 posts, you could read what was relevant to you. I have no ML or AI background, given that I found the lectures very informative, some students in the class who had taken ML didn't like the contents much! The lectures make the concepts look very easy because they use very simple daily life example but when you want to write the assignment on a useful AI problem, it is very very tough!! The projects are solving RPM puzzles; while it was enjoyable and rewarding to write python programs that solve complex visual analogy puzzles, I felt let down that I couldn't use any of the AI concepts that we learnt in them. At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program. From Spring 2016, the course work is cut down a bit, we only had 3 assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm and 1 final. We get 3 weeks for doing the project and 1 week for assignments. Midterm and final are both open ended and open book and are given 1 week each. I have given 15 hours/week but I think you can do with 10 hours/week if you are very goal oriented and super focused unlike me. Whatever be your specialization, I think you should take this course to get the most professional OMSCS experience!!",

I've taken a few other classes before and they all had a major disconnect between lectures and assignments -- the lectures were very thin compared to what was expected and a lot of self researching was needed. Dr. Bobick really does care about teaching this subject and wants you to understand and appreciate it fully and this shows easily in his lectures, which are formatted logically and are exhaustive (well, atleast for an intro course.. ). The TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, made good comments when assignments were returned. \n\nRegarding the content of the course, much of your time will be spent on parameter tuning rather than implementing concepts and algorithm (especially in problem set 2, the hardest one IMO). So it is a good idea to play with the parameters early in the course and get an understanding of how they change the results. It does get a bit math intensive towards the middle and latter part of the course so brushing up on your linear algebra would go a long way. The final was open-book and was quite easy and straightforward sticking to higher level questions than mundane specifics. \n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this class to bits and would easily recommend it to anyone looking to dive into this wonderful and nascent field!",

The Udacity lectures are simplistic and useless, although hilarious, since the presenter sounds like Elmer Fudd. The new Prof prioritized making this a weeder course. Valid solutions were not provided for prob sets, reason given was to have students work things out on their own. Side effect was that graded HW feedback could not be argued by students, as there was no ground truth to compare to. Much time was spent trying to \"prove\" things that had little to no practical real world value, (Cantor's diagonal argument). Difficulty defending any proof other than what TA's had in mind, or on answer sheet. Akin to religious argumentation. Prof mentioned struggling with 6505 himself when he took it recently. Seems this was payback time for the next batch of students. \n\nWarning, all online resources were banned. An ultimatum was issued halfway through the course for students to admit to having \"Googled\" to receive 0 on an assignment and have a note added to their permanent record to avoid more severe punishment. It seems several students had OSI investigations launched and received \"I\" incomplete or \"F\" on their transcripts. Imagine having this happen to you for looking something up on Wikipedia. \n\nUpdate: IRP stats are now up. http://www. irp. gatech. edu/reports/grades_by_instructorsmry. php. \nPryby - Spring2016 A:32, B:63, C:64, F:8, I:3, Total:170, (W:132) 44% failed\nBrubaker - Spring2015 A:38, B:15, C:9, D:11, U:1, Total:74, (W:107) 28% failed\nConsidering a C is not a passing grade for many specializations it is pretty severe that 44% of the non withdrawn students do not receive an acceptable grade.

I would recommend starting on projects when they are released, as if you do not, you will end up having to pull some late nights. The lectures were informative, but really did not cover what you needed to do on projects and assignments in great detail, though I think the professor's point that you cannot teach design through lectures is valid. \n\nThe one thing I really did not like about the course was the choice of technologies we had to work with. The projects involved implementing a tool called Gurobi, which is very poorly documented, and very hard to work with unless you understand what you are doing. For the first project especially, I spent at least 75% of my time trying to get Gurobi to work and 25% actually focusing on what the course teaches. ",

You don't need to have a project in mind before starting the class but since all the activities since week two are directed towards researching your problem space, you'll need to land on one pretty quickly. Alternatively, you can join someone else's project, which I'd probably recommend even if you have your own idea. With more people on the team, you can combine your efforts, build something more polished, and have more fun along the way. Otherwise, despite encouraging feedback from peer reviews, you might feel a little lonely in your one-man-project. \n\nDuring the first 5 weeks, there will be a short (~500 words) written submission documenting your research every week, followed by project proposal. In the next 8 weeks, you'll be working on the project, summarizing your progress in a short text or video recording every other week. In the final two weeks, you will combine all your previous notes and research to write an academic paper in a format and quality to be presented at a scientific conference. You don't have to officially submit it but even without doing so, you'll have gone through the entire process of researching a topic, identifiying a problem, designing a solution, and writing a paper about it. \n\nThe structure of the course is very free-form. There are no common videos or texts to read -- instead, you'll be expected to do your own research (i. e. find relevant papers, learn tools you want to use). There is a suggested breakdown of how much time you should spend on research/review/writing/programming in a given week (~10h/w total), but the actual content varies for each student. The plus side is, you'll be assigned a mentor who will guide you on your journey. And if you've known David Joyner for a while, you can be sure he'll post weekly plan and summary announcements, daily discussion threads, and reply to almost every comment. ",

I tried my best to be fair & hopefully it helps others. I got a B in this class. \n\nContent: Videos are highly analytic & professor often uses “so” & “therefore” to skip explaining a concept. I took this class under the impression that it’s related to the standard testing/QA but it was mostly about compiler design/efficiency. Video lectures quality is overall low especially towards the end. \nPre-requisites: Pre-reqs were removed from the course page later on. You need to be proficient in Java, C, discrete math …\nExams: I’ll summarize it with this epic story: Instructor posted a pdf with sample questions prior to the midterm & based on the comments on Piazza, majority of the class simply thought that he posted the wrong pdf or in the wrong class. Average for the midterm exam was in mid-50. Hopefully you can understand the gap here\nAssignments: They are written in a very dense academic format. Professor & the TAs weren’t helpful in explaining the assignment, providing resources or answering Piazza questions. They run a plagiarism program over all the assignments & you can end up at the dean office or get an F if they find you plagiarized. \nPiazza: Professor & TAs are very detached from Piazza but you see lots of helpful comment from the top 5% of the class. Anon post are not allowed. \nProfessor/TA: In a nutshell I think I’d have enjoyed this class a lot more if we had an active/engaged, professional & experienced professor. The staff was not open to any suggestion or feedback. I felt they were very much used to the on-campus traditional style of teaching & communication with students. Professor Mayur only showed up to say the harsh words or threaten students. Before finals week he sent a mass email saying: “I find that you plagiarized in this assignment while grading, the consequences will be severe: an F grade in this entire course. ”",

Having said that if you want to get an A, you have to focus on the details of each assignment and project, making sure to deliver what the instructors expect from those assignments and projects (make sure to attend/play later the ‘optional’ office hours too, as often clarifications are given here - even though usually the piazza also has a corresponding thread). For some deliverables, the instructors may deduct quite some points for non-compliant items, so don’t underestimate the seems to be easy assignments and projects. The grades are also not curved (90+ to get an A) so it is important to get a good grade for every assignment/project. \n\nOverall, it is a great course, and I recommend taking it especially for new students as an introductory course to OMSCS and Software Engineering.

            "text": "This was a very tough class, but there were both pros and cons. \n\nAssignments - aside from the last assignment (which i simply couldn't complete even after ~40 hours), they were all very well done and a bit fun. Some take an insane amount of time to complete, while others are very easy. The overall balance felt about right for the assignments. \n\nUdacity - Some lectures were better than others, but the quizzes in them were excellent. They really helped you learn the material. Very well thought out and the best quizzes out of any class I've taken. \n\nExams - horrendous. Absolutely did not test our knoweldge of the material whatsoever. Questions came out of complete left field and I feel are more ego-driven to show off how smart the professor is and his vast amount of knoweldge outside of Software testing than to actually test us on what we know. I failed the final and got a D on the midterm. But then again, the median grade for each was in the D/F range -- this alone speaks volumes. \n\nTime spent - This is hard to calculate, as some weeks were 40 hours, and then there were stretches of time where there was no work whatsoever. It fluctuates a lot, but I would say each assignment is 10-15 hours on average, and there were 8 assignments. \n\nA word of warning - this professor is absolutely obsessed with finding and punishing people who copy or reference code from other students or past classes. Multiple announcements were made throughout the semester, warning students of getting an F in the class and using heavy threats demanding \"they know who cheated, but if the student turns themselves in the punishment will be far less severe. \" The constant threats were irritating and seemed to really negatively affect student morale, especially the honest ones. This was very unprofessional and should have been handled discretely without obnoxiously threatening the entire class. \n\nAll in all. It was a solid class with a good amount of work. Grading was generous, even with the impossible exams. ",

Grading is curved and fair. Teacher and TA's are one of the best in the programs. The lectures could be improved to cover more materials required to complete the assignments as well as super important in any AI course (for example, Markov Chain); I have spent considerable amount of time learning concepts from outside source (online academic source, somewhat ironically) to complete assignments.

Great course that focuses on how classic CS concepts like graph theory can be practically applied by tailoring software for embedded systems. \n\nThis class isn't a hardware course, nor is it a course on how to write software for an embedded system. It's a class on how software is manipulated to run efficiently on power, hardware, and size limited devices. \n\nIt covers:\nembedded system instruction set architectures\nhardware support \ninstruction level parallelism\npipelining\nand compiler optimizations that take regular code and compile it such that it can run on embedded systems. \n\nThe course was condensed for summer but I think we still covered the same material. We had 4 homework assignments (initially 5), each taking about 5-15 hours to complete over 2 weeks. There was one project, taking about 20-25 hours to complete over a moth. There were also homework assignments due during this time. I think the full semester may have two projects, and two more homeworks that were smaller. \n\nThere was a proctored midterm and will be a proctored final, the midterm took an hour to complete (you get two hours). The level of difficulty was on par with the homework, but the test is closed notes. \n\nIn the condensed semester there were 2 lectures series and a reading per week for the first half, dropping to one of each after the midterm. The hardest thing to keep up with is covering the material in order to do the homeworks and take the tests, I recommend watching at 1. 25 speed due to reduce time spent. \n\nThe project and one homework were C++ programs. You can do this in your own environment, but you will run some code on GT's deepthought cluster via SSH. There's no GUI, but all you need are basic Linux commands. The assignments were straightforward implementations of concepts from the lectures/readings. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this course. If you are taking CCA, this course will apply some of the Graph theory concepts covered there. ",

It's somewhat more difficult, but that's not saying much. \n\nGrading consists of two rote memorization exams (easy), a lot of open book quizzes (which themselves appear to be plagiarized from Quizlet, so you know.. google them), and some projects (moderate difficulty). \n\nThe lectures are okay, if boring. I really can't complain about them. \n\nThe projects are really only a challenge whenever the questions are ambiguous, nonsense, or rewritten by the TAs after release (formally or informally on Piazza via \"clarifications\"). \n\nTAs are not very responsive on the forums, from what I've seen. \n\nThis course does not meet my expectations for this program. It's certainly not on the same level as the CV, RLDM, ML, or CCA, etc. On the other hand, if you find yourself out of interesting courses to take and want to just finish the program, here's an easy A.

            "text": "This course - at its core - teaches two things:\n\n1) the syntax and conventions of UML diagrams: class, sequence, state chart make up the major players. Other diagrams get supporting roles. \n\n2) the taxonomy of architectural patterns that arose as software systems and their teams became larger over the history of the industry\n\nIt delivers on those two fairly well. However the standout feature of the course, to me, was ILP (integer linear programming) with the commercial-grade solver Gurobi. I knew nothing about ILP and now I can't get enough. I have an extensive Java background, so learning \"ILP in Java\" meant one new thing paired with one old thing. NC State University hosts a large library of Gurobi code samples in multiple languages. Find them!\n\nEvery silver cloud must have a dark lining, so caveats from my view:\n\n1) grades focus on the _syntax_ of your diagrams, not the quality of the architecture expressed. I got all points on syntax-perfect diagrams of ideas I considered underwhelming. \n\n2) in summer, grading took forever. I didn't get any informative grades until two days before the drop-with-W date. You cover half the courses' content before you get grades on the first real assignments. \n\n3) also in summer, course staff did not assign any OCL homework, despite several hours of lectures and a reading on OCL in the syllabus. a one hour overview would suffice, without using OCL for any assignments where we can practice and receive feedback. \n\n4) another summer specific comment: some assignment windows overlapped, including the final project.

They ranged from straightforward to tedious due to the wide range of skills needed. For example, the first assignment favored those who had a C-background while the last assignment favored those who were savvy with JavaScript. I would recommend doing a 'bonus' project, preferably one which is geared towards your own skill set. \n\nLectures were split between Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee. Those given by Ahamad will literally put you to sleep. Lee keep a more brisk pace. I am not big into reading text books at all, but willed myself into reading this time due to many of the quiz (and therefore midterm and final) questions being pull from there. The quizzes are open book/notes and answers can easily be found online, but it is recommended to first attempt them without assistance since the midterm and final are closed book/notes. \n\nThe main reason that I took and would recommend this class is if you are going for the Computing Systems concentration.

As others pointed out, there is a large breadth of topics covered (and a corresponding lack of depth), which similarly has pros and cons. \n\nThe good: A lot of the topics are quite interesting, and if you are not a security person already, you will probably leave this class more aware of some area(s) of security that can help you in your career. The technical meat of some of the projects can be both interesting, challenging, and fun. They make it easy to get an A if you put in the effort. \n\nThe bad: Sometimes, getting started on the projects is hard for the wrong reasons (environment setup, somewhat lacking documentation for specific things, etc). It is nothing that one can't get past, but if you have limited cycles, those problems can at times be frustrating. The really unfortunate result of that was that it was the crack in the foundation of the class opened up the floodgates of incessant whining on Piazza. I understand a bit of grumbling about the project setup problems, but people started complaining about every little thing, when the reality was that most people probably did fine in the class. I truly believe that if we hadn't had those project problems, people would not have complained so much about other things. Sorry fellow students, but please make sure you are making a constructive comment before you reach for that \"anonymous\" button!\n\nThe ugly: As with any security class, you will leave realizing how insecure everything is. Good luck sleeping!\n\nSecret key to success: Buckle down and do the readings (don't just skim!). It will makes the quizzes and exams easier, and there is sometimes a deeper dive of content, or even non-overlapping content in the texts. You will get more out of the class. \n\nFinal note: To the anyone that suggests Googling for quiz answers: are you sure you want to be in the program? If you just want a piece of paper, I there are some other lovely online degrees you can pursue. ",

Also, I would suggest those who do not program or have very little coding experience NOT take this class until you've had some experience coding or at least really understand the math (linear algebra and trig) that is necessary. While the sheer number of lines of code necessary isn't huge, the application of the concepts require some experience with programming languages (preferably Python but you can pick Python up if you know Java or C). Also, reading other comments here, they've made some changes to the course. Submission of Project 1 is no longer via Udacity. The Udacity grader is still in place and you can use it for testing, but your submission is via tSquare. Finally, I agree the videos could've contained a little more in depth content, as the concepts needed for the projects are not covered in great detail in lecture. Outside research is required if you are not already familiar with the information. This can take more time than counted on but does lead to learning. ",

This is a good summer class, or something to pair with a crazy hard class -- there isn't really enough material in the course to fill a full semester. \n\nThe problem sets from lecture are very simplistic. It typically required more time to figure out how to perform the required actions using their custom implementation of a matrix class (with a very un-pythonic API) than to actually solve the problems. It is possible to frontload all of the lecture material, but you can't get too far ahead because the project details were not released until much later. \n\nIt seems like the staff is well aware of the issues, because the bulk of the final grade (~75%) comes from one individual project and a group final project, and they encouraged \"optional\" pseudo-extra-credit assignments to research and/or implement many of the more advance concepts (beyond the scope of lectures). The individual project is available on Udacity, but don't work too far ahead until they release all of the details. The group project is... a group project (yuck!) with scores determined (in part) through competition with the other teams (ugh). In both projects, it isn't clear what the learning objectives are, since the techniques taught in the class typically produce very poor results without extensive additional effort, while other techniques often perform surprisingly well with very little effort. \n\nThe class seems designed to run on autopilot for the staff, and peer learning is limited because the material does not lend itself well to group discussion -- especially on the final project where discussion with other teams may cost you a competitive advantage.

This course addressing the topic of artificial intelligence from a methodological standpoint rather than discussing the algorithms and frameworks for implementations. It is important to set your expectation straight before jumping into this course. David Joyner is an exceptionally good teacher. GATech is lucky to have him. \n\nThough solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices in course project is fun, I have to say this course is pedagogically flawed. First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words? The most funny part is the TA's feedback, which goes like: How well does the assignment describe the problem it is attempting to solve?: 5 …. Though I got really good grades, I am very sure that I learned nothing from the assignments. I was really close to quit this course after reading the TA's feedback to my first assignment. ",

That being said, the material is broad and not very deep. This is definitely a survey course. \n\nGrading: For this term, 20% of the final grade comes from ten quizzes (open book/open note), 60% from four projects (equally weighted), and 20% from two exams (equally weighted). The exams are a midterm and final, and the final is not cumulative. \n\nThe projects: These took me from 6 to 12 hours each. The projects were:\n1. Execute a buffer overflow attack - make sure you're up on your C programming and have an intimate knowledge of how the OS lays programs out in memory. \n2. Malware analysis - we used a virtual machine to safely study malware. This project is basically following the instructions with no independent thought. \n3. Cryptography - implement cipher block chaining, and search a keyspace to try to crack ciphertext. Your choice of Python or Java for the assignment. \n4. Web security - launch a XSS, XSRF, and SQL injection attack against pre-supplied PHP code. \n\nAs you can see, these projects target different skillsets. You may have an easy time with one over the other. \n\nThe exams: There is very little required in the way of synthesis with the material, but there is a LOT of material to learn. The class average for the first exam was an 80. I'm writing this before getting the results of the final exam. \n\nBonus project: the professors graciously allowed us a 10% extra credit project. Do it - it's fire insurance against a bad exam performance and can almost guarantee you the A. \n\nFinal verdict: this class was fun, and I learned a lot. When you solve the projects, it feels like magic (OMG - I just launched a buffer overflow attack!). I'd recommend this course. ",

Each project is very easy if you have decent programming experience in Python or a similar language. To be honest, I felt like they were too easy (though I did learn something from most of them). Be sure to do well on the projects so that you have some room to not do so well on the tests. \n\nTests 40% I studied 20+ hours for both tests, but much of that was catching up on lectures I had fallen behind on. Before the curve, I got B's on the tests (A's after the adjustment). From what I understand, the Spring 2016 offering was the first to incorporate 2 tests whereas previous semester had quizzes. Be warned, from what I can tell, these tests are much harder than those quizzes ever were. The tests did not cover anything that wasn't in the lectures/homework/papers, but they covered a vast amount of content. Take good notes on the lectures AND study them and you should be fine. \n\nHomeworks: The homeworks are optional but not optional if you want to do well on the tests. \n\nPapers: There were several academic papers for us to read. They varied in difficulty, but a couple of them were very long. However, the tests and the projects didn't seem to test our knowledge of them very extensively (other than what was in the homeworks). \n\nLectures: These are good, but they are not very consistent in the amount of detail covered. Some topics are covered in much detail while others are not. It would be nice if each one had optional readings associated with them. The are very few difficult concepts presented in the class. \n\nOverall Thoughts: Having never taken an undergraduate networking course, I felt like I learned a good bit in this class. The class really isn't that hard. I felt like it was worthwhile for me. ",

            "text": "I enjoyed this class. The content was very interesting and the TAs were helpful and active on Piazza. Content was completing problems on Udacity (24%) in Weeks 1 to 6, runaway robot (36%) and the final project of predicting the future location of a small robot (hexbug) (40%). I think the course was a lot harder than some of these reviews suggest. \n\nThere were two types of challenges for extra credit: research challenges and hardware challenges. I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project. \n\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A). \n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda! \n\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don't regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work. \n\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution. ",

            "text": "This course is a survey on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making techniques. There are weekly assigned lectures and readings (papers provided by the instructor). \n\nOn Summer, an assignment was due every week, I'd say their goal was assessing that the students understood concepts explained on the lectures. You do not submit code, only results, so you could solve them with Java, Python, Excel, pencil and paper. There's an auto grader available! Some assignments were more interesting than others. \n\nIn Summer we only had one final exam (25 true/false questions, and you had to explain your answer). It was hard to cram all that information in one week (assuming you started to study once you submitted the final project). It seems that in full semesters, a midterm was also part of the evaluation, that would have made the load more manageable. \n\nFor both projects assigned (midterm and final project) we had to replicate the results of published RL papers. We had to explain about our implementation, the assumptions we made, the difficulties we had, etc. You can use any language/library since code was not submitted, only the report and a 3-minute video presentation. You learn a LOT doing that. Start working as soon as you can in the projects! \n\nAt the end, the grading was generous, since people who were on the C (70-80%) or B (80-90%) brackets, ended up earning the upper grade (B, A, respectively)\n\nI highly recommend this course if you are interested on the topic. You can go as deep as you want in the material. The resources shared by the instructor are gold, and will give you many ideas for future work or research. ",

The lectures are informative and thought-provoking, but there's not a whole lot of depth. Perhaps the suggested readings were intended to supply the depth, but I didn't find them necessary for success in the course.

The project is an app to support transaction processing and report generation, with the first phases consisting of logical modeling, turning in a few diagrams and reports, involving maybe a few hours of work on each person's part. \n\nThen you implement it. It's not a huge chore, but you have to build the database, find a place to host it, connect it to a server with the business logic, with a working ui on the front end that supports all of the required forms. To prove it works, you populate it with a dummy history. Simple enough, but right at the last minute, they threw up samples that had to be in with specific dates that were months in the past. If you implemented a correct database, one of the constraints is transactions can't take place in the past, so at the last minute you go in, remove the constraints, throw in the transactions, fix the schema and hope you didn't break anything so the gotchas in your demo don't return bad query results. \n\nThe kicker is the final is a few days later, covering material that bears no relation to anything else we did (indexing and physical file organization), from lectures that weren't available on Udacity until a few weeks prior when we were right in the heat of the project. That project, which takes up more time than the rest of the course combined, is worth 10% of the grade, and the exams are all multiple choice with 0 partial credit, so you get the final asking you exactly how many bytes are required to implement a specific kind of dense index and if you're off by 20, 0 points. 25 questions, so 3 wrong and you no longer have an A. There's no curve, so you can see for yourself that somehow one of the easiest courses in the program ends up with one of the lowest grade distributions. All because of highly weighted exams that were regularly regraded because the answer keys were wrong or in some cases the questions didn't even have clear right answers at all. ",

You start with very small toy problems that can be solved directly using dynamic programming. From there, you gradually introduce the complications of the real world - infinite state spaces, stochastic reward functions, the inclusion of other agents that may be cooperative, adversarial, or indifferent, all the while learning of research from the past few decades resulting in tractable ways to induce human-or-better levels of performance in domains such as game play, autonomous drone flight, logistics scheduling, teaching robots to walk. \n\nThe idea is absurdly simple. Start with effectively random prediction of how well particular primitive actions might work and successively refine those predictions from whatever feedback you eventually receive, which may or may not be accurate feedback. Somehow this works, and this course gives you a mix of the mathematics to prove when and why it works, why it might work in practice even if you can't prove it works, and some of the practical research leading to hacks and tricks that make it work faster, better, or both. \n\nThe pros are the lectures and readings are engaging, insightful, among the best you'll get in this program. The projects, reproducing published research, give you the valuable real-world experience of just hacking away and making educated guesses until success magically happens. Then you have to figure out how it happened and be able to explain it. \n\nThe con is the weekly homeworks are too easy, simple algebra problems that might take a few lines of code but sometimes you can just do in your head, none of which take more than a couple minutes, basically free points. That time could be devoted to more projects. Function approximation (deep RL) especially is critical and hot and in the headlines and we barely covered it. ",

In project work, visual approach is mandatory by the end and it involves mostly ad-hoc heuristics for RPM problems rather than any widely applicable AI algorithms. So you don't get hands on practice of learnt concepts.

On the one hand it may expand your mind and you'll see connections and duality of many classes of problems, you'll spend time trying to fathom infinities that are greater than other infinities and create programs that consume themselves and result in contradictions. On the other hand you may experience extreme anxiety, delusions, dissociation, lack of sleep, and paranoia. You may have a bad trip. \n\nThat said this class is not really the monster it is made out to be. Complaints about it being too mathy or taught by a math professor are misguided. It is very mathy and you should accept that for a theoretical computer science course. For a graduate program you should also be prepared to write proofs and reason mathematically about the algorithms. \n\nTo stretch the analogy, going into CCA high on anxiety and fear will not help you out. Be prepared but not afraid. To prepare: watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation series on YouTube while you read along with your copy of Sipser for the Computability part of the course. Watch the first 3 lectures from MIT OCW Math for Computer Science to warm you up on proofs. Start going through chapters of CLRS that match the complexity and algorithms part of the course. In particular pay attention to graph algorithms, dynamic programming and linear programming as they are a big part of the final algorithms section. Practice all the reductions you can for the complexity section. The format may change semester to semester, but here's a hint: if they give you practice problems - practice them - all of them - because the practice problems may show up on the exams. ;)\n\nLastly, don't delay the course. Maybe not make it your 1st course, but making it the last is not advised since that will just add to the stress of taking it. The best way to prepare for CCA is to take CCA. Good luck. ",

The lectures were fun, although Professor Thrun's relentless encouragement seemed sarcastic at times. I certainly agree with other reviewers when they said certain concepts were only mentioned in passing before having to implement them in the next section, but since you could always look at the answer, it didn't seem like as much of a road block. \n\nThe rest of the class seemed like a disaster. Thrun's lack of interaction with the class, although understandable, was certainly a bummer. The TAs seemed like they were planning on dropping there interaction level from the start. Strict adherence to policy with little to no personal responsibility for actually nurturing understanding. They dangled an extra-credit-carrot for piazza posts, which is just stupid at a fundamental level. You have a torrent of answers from C students instead of just the normal overachievers; it made piazza pretty much unusable. \n\nThe pacing of the course is also completely out-of-whack. In the beginning it seems like you can just do a lecture a week and you will be fine, as they take only an hour or so. By the final lecture you are having to do additional research and re-watch videos in order to understand the concepts and they end up taking much longer. By the time the projects start (if you don't front-load) you feel like you are constantly playing catch-up. This only adds to the stress you feel because the projects don't really line up with any of the lectures. ",

The lecture videos give a decent introduction to the topic & rest of the details had to be uncovered in the research papers on the topics. \nThe assignments were mostly appropriate to the topics covered in lectures. The TAs as well as Prof. were always active on piazza to that was helpful.

I took it over the summer and was disappointed that Dr. Isbell was not very interactive in the class... the TAs ran the show daily/weekly. They were extremely helpful and responsive (above average). As always, start everything early. There were two projects and a single (final) exam over the summer, but I understand the 'regular' semesters have had a 3rd project and an extra exam. New developments for the summer: The class was language agnostic and you didn't have to submit code... just auto-graded for the weekly assignments. No code submission for the projects... just a report and video presentation. Some of my grades on the projects and exam were definitely not that great, but overall grading was fair given the class changes and compressed summer schedule. I'd say it's a must-take if you're interested in RL. There's a ton of reading, though, and the lectures are fairly dense... not a class you can run the videos on 2x the first time through!",

I had prior backgrounds on some of the topics covered, and this class helped me to assemble the bits and pieces together. \n\nLectures: they cover really broad range of topics, from buffer overflow (low level application security) to web security. Each topic is not discussed in great details, but given that this course is an introductory course, this is quite expected. \n\nQuizzes: Most of the questions are taken straight from the book. If you watch the lectures and read the book, it is very easy to get 100% for the quizzes. \n\nProjects: The projects are fun, and help to understand and appreciate the topics better. Sometimes it takes a while to get what each project is about, but once you get a hang of it, the project can be done in a reasonable amount of time. (I spent about 7 - 10 hours per project) Furthermore the classmates are very helpful with the projects, even to the extent of almost giving away some of the answers. Most of the projects are auto-graded, so the answers are only either correct or wrong and no room for subjectivity. There were some hiccups with the auto-grading but the TAs quickly rectified them. \n\nExams: Similar level of difficulty with quizzes, not that challenging but good understanding of the concepts is needed to provide correct answers. \n\nOptional projects: Intended to be a grade boost, but it seems everybody did quite well so that the final grade curve was also boosted. Students are allowed to submit multiple optional projects but only one will go into the final grade. \n\nOverall it is a fun class, worth taking if you have little or no background in computer security. The workload is quite reasonable, and definitely will be lighter on normal spring / fall semesters. ",

The final project was especially rewarding. The exam was \"check all that apply\" multiple choice, appeared deliberately vague and misleading in places, and was a mess in my opinion. \n\nAdministration of the class this summer was also troubling. The professor was entirely absent - he weighed in twice in Piazza and was otherwise absent, and his TAs appeared to have trouble getting guidance on simple questions that needed to be answered for assignments that had been changed (e. g. \"Can we use X function, or is it in the group that is not allowed?\"), leading to confusion and frustration on the part of students.

This course teaches a lot of the fundamental software development processes and techniques that you need to know in the real world but that aren't necessarily taught in undergrad or other grad classes. I would definitely recommend it as the first course you take in OMSCS and also strongly recommend it if you haven't worked as a professional software developer but are looking to break into the field in the future. \n\nI have been a professional software developer for 10 years so I wasn't sure how much I would get out of the class however I did learn some new tricks and techniques in it so I think it is worth it even for people who have done software development in the \"real world. \" \n\nThe class strikes a good balance between learning new subjects in the lectures and testing that knowledge by doing fairly simple programming assignments. The class is paced well and I didn't feel overburdened except for a couple weeks where we had invidividual and group assignments in the same week. \n\nThe group project, like all group projects, is hit and miss depending on the group members you are assigned. If you have someone not pulling their weight it can be a nuisance. That said the grading in general is fairly generous as long as you put forth effort.",

The projects, I felt, were certainly interesting, but in most cases you're just reaching for the hacky solution that will get the best score. This isn't necessarily great if the objective is learning about the concepts, and it isn't necessarily fair for those less hacky of us, either. However, Joyner is a champion, and he made this course a joy. TA's are very involved on Piazza and there were a lot of interesting discussions going on. My favorite of OMSCS so far, but like I said, I might give this 5 stars but it isn't perfect. I felt the course was overly slanted towards projects in grading, to be honest.",

They attempted to be fair for the most part and I appreciate their efforts. \n\nNow for the negatives. First problem, completely non-existent professor. He never showed up once and coming from a class last semester where the professor was heavily involved this was a let down. The videos were also weak in a number of areas where complicated concepts were glossed over and never really explained in great detail leaving the TAs to have to try and explain these concepts. The class also seemed to have copied in large part the material from a Stanford course CS295. Some of the assignments for example were taken word for word from the Stanford assignments. Luckily some of the videos from Stanford explain the material way better. I find this really disgusting considering we are always asked not to plagiarize. \n\nOverall the material was not what I was expecting. A number of assignments used libraries with little or no documentation that was often times inaccurate or was utilizing libraries on projects that had been abandoned years before. I really think this class could be better described as to what it is covering and better if some of the more useless aspects were removed. There was some good material but it was mostly hidden away behind all the useless items I had to learn about.",

What he really needs to say is, \"If you don't understand the math for this, run away, far, far, away. \" Because, when it comes time for the projects, you will need to implement some of these algebra or calculus functions on your own. My math skills are weak (and I'm working on bringing them up with outside coursework because math is the foundation for all that we do) and my mathematical programming skills (especially for Python) weaker. \n\nI understand that from my personal perspective, I was not \"ready\" for this course. And the shortened schedule of summer semester means if you aren't ready, you are either expecting a moment of genius, or are going to drop the course. You can guess which one I chose. Others with a deeper background and familiarity with the basic concepts presented in the course, and an understanding of the logical processes required, will do just fine.

That is, to be awarded a B, one must average strictly greater than 3 points per problem. \n\nThere have been several changes since the previous time I took this course in Spring 2015:\n\n- Starts with algorithms instead of decidability/complexity. \n- New and better videos. \n- More active TAs with higher quality office hours. \n- No graded homework assignments. \n- More exams each with fewer questions. \n\nWhile there are no graded homework assignments, a problem set consisting of 5-8 questions is made available every week. Practice exams are also provided. \n\nThe exams themselves have matched the content and difficulty of the problem sets and practice exams, though one could argue the problem sets and practice exams are more challenging. This appears to be intentional. \n\nI'm glad to see the program is responding to student feedback, even if little by little. \n\nLastly, the topics covered in this course, especially in algorithms, are invaluable. While your day-to-day as a fill-in-the-blank may not require asymptotic analysis, amortized analysis, dynamic programming, or the like, the critical and analytical thinking skills that this course forces one to develop are well worth the pain.",

Coming from a SAS-heavy background with no knowledge of R, I've appreciated the opportunity to get my hands into data manipulation and visualization using R. We also had the opportunity to learn the mechanics behind linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization. \n\nThere are 4 homeworks (technically 3, but the 3rd counts as double and is twice as long), all of which have been doable in a reasonable amount of time. The project this semester is divided into two parts, and is about analyzing and visualizing movie characteristics from IMDB's database to find the best predictors for gross revenue. I thought it was pretty neat to be given a real world problem with imperfect data to analyze. Don't procrastinate on the project. Unless you're really handy with R, it'll probably take 30-50 hours for each part (divided into two parts, due at different times). \n\nI really enjoy watching the lectures (sped up to 1. 5x), and the professor provides the lecture slides so you can actually just sit, comprehend, and follow the notes rather than screenshotting the video every two minutes.

Writing snort rules was not particularly hard, but the way the assignment was presented was pretty vague. After prodding the TA we were given some, but not enough in my opinion, additional information. In particular, we were asked to write rules \"with a long shelf life\". There was some comedy here when some of the \"benign\" traffic that was sampled included browsing an adult e-commerce store. Somebody complained and they issued alternate traffic to analyze for those who were offended. \n\nThe last assignment was somewhere between the first and second in terms of effort and required using an ML toolkit to analyze network traffic. Most of the code was provide to us, but it does take some time to figure out how things are setup.

I myself had no prior experience and really wanted to apply myself so that I can properly internalize the core concepts and found myself working around 20 hours a week. However someone with experience in ML and ML4T can get by with no more than 10 hours a week of effort. \n- Math is a tough thing to get up to speed on but we have had some really engaging piazza discussions that solidified my understanding and the students really take it upon themselves to make sure their fellow classmates are in a position to succeed. It's great. \n- Instructor is very responsive and I have yet to see a relevant question unanswered by him. Hes got some great experience in ML and does a good job of breaking down the concepts into digestible chunks. \n\nFinal takeaway is to definitely take this class if you are in the ML track but if you are already quite proficient in ML and R, this class may not give you anything more.",

For those who are concerned about the amount of time the class consumes, those times are mostly based on students satisfying all project requirements, studying to do well on the exams, and completing the extra credit. If the curve is consistent from semester to semester, you can probably cut quite a few corners and still get an 'A'; if you are only shooting for a 'B' you can do even less (do so at your own risk!). \n\nNote: The structure of this class is learn about an abstract OS concept and then develop an application that uses that linux implementation of that OS concept. For example: learn about threading -> implement a program that uses linux pthreads. This is not a class where you have to implement the OS construct (I think that is reserved for AOS).",

The actual coding of the class project was beyond my technical capabilities without a lot of additional work, but fortunately some of my teammates were well versed in programming Java and Android, and I was able to pick up more/most of the work on the requirements and documentation side to make up for it, which obviously helped and felt like a fair distribution. You will need some basic Java programming on your own as well, but if you have any kind of a programming background and take any beginners-level course, like the one offered by Udacity, you'll be fine. The instructors is fantastic and funny, and the TA's are very helpful and responsive. We went nuts with Piazza, which made it hard to keep up with, but that was our fault.

With one month to go, I do not think I would recommend this course over other courses which have deeper roots in math. The lectures are full of high level concepts and the ideas seem very familiar. It feels like a lot of the material is stuff that most students should already know, but with new terminology. \n\nThe Ravens project was interesting for the first and second iteration. Doing the verbal approach in the first felt like a direct application of the earlier AI concepts. Attempting the visual approach for the second felt less so. I have not started on the third part, but I have ideas on what to implement at this point, and it might not be based on any of the concepts in this course. There are some students that will be creating an AI chatbot for their third project, and they may find more success in using the material from this course. It feels like the Ravens agent does not have a feedback loop to improve itself and is therefore lacking in the learning portion of an AI agent. \n\nThere is a bit of writing required for this course. The reflection papers that are required with each project submission are not so bad, since the students write about what they implemented and relate it back to the class topics. The stand alone assignments were slightly aggravating, because you talk about the general topics and how they could potentially be used to solve difficult problems. The mid-term felt the same. It was difficult to judge how in depth to go into the problems. And it was also tough to know if the solutions were implementable. It would have been nice to do smaller coding assignments and write on those experiences. Although, I may be in the minority with this feeling, because from the peer feedback system I came across a number of nice papers filled with figures and well thought out solutions.",

The material was mostly review for me, although it had been a while since I used relational algebra and I had not have any formal training on functional dependencies before. \n\nWhile the material was pretty easy, the workload was not as light for me as it was for others. Every week or other week there was a project due or an exam to study for. The book is of limited value, but I recommend getting a copy to lookup some of the more obscure questions during tests. The 4th test was by far the hardest for me, so just because you demo'd your project to the TAs does not mean that you are out of the woods. \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned, some students had ProctorTrack issues with exam 3 and the TAs ended up dropping the lowest of our first 3 test grades to compensate. It is hard to say here who was at fault since the majority of us were able to complete the exam. There were also reports of students not downloading the diagrams ahead of time on the first 2 exams as instructed, which makes me wonder if there was not a bit of user error here. If you are in a graduate CS program and cannot figure out how to get proctoring software to work on your workstation, then you may be in the wrong field of study. It is possible that there were some technical diffuculties, but I am personally not convinced. \n\nAnother issue in my opinion is in regards to the weight that is placed on the part 3 of the class project. This is by far the most time consuming part of the class and is worth the same as parts 1 and 2. Based on level of effort alone, it feels like it should be worth what parts 1 and 2 were combined (i. e. double). \n\nOn a positive note, the lectures were pretty entertaining as the professor is somewhat of an amateur comedian. \n\nIn my opinion, this is good fit for those looking to obtain the Computing Systems specialization, even though my run of the course did not go off without a hitch.",

The tests and quizzes are multiple choice and pretty much straight from the book and lectures, but the questions are sometimes a bit ambiguous. \n\nThis is a good course to pair with if you're taking more than one.",

            "text": "I want to start with the positives. Some of the lectures in the course really *are* interesting. I especially liked the topics of incremental concept learning, common-sense reasoning, diagnosis, and some of the videos on biology-inspired design. I also think that while writing all of those papers does get a bit old, it lets you think creatively and try to apply the topics which were learned in lectures. The experience ends up being a bit shallow since you are writing a single paper on something and then moving on, but I guess it is hard to expect more from a course that covers so many topics. The do provide a ton of extra material for you to go read on your own, and some people do that extra work and seem like they get much more out of the class if you are willing to put in the effort. \n\nA lot of the negative comments others make about this course are definitely valid. Some of the lecture material is just not deep enough, and I find myself tuning it out. This is my 6th course in the program, and I haven't had that problem very often. In addition, the three-part Ravens Matrices project gets old. I also feel like the \"no image processing experience is required\" is technically true, but I feel it would be awfully useful to have that experience. But the biggest problem with the projects is that it is hard to apply what was learned in the lectures beyond the first couple of lessons. I don't think this is specific to the problem being solved, but it is the nature of the requirements and the amount of time you have. \n\nOn a final optimistic note, I think that the alternative project 3 that was proposed is much more suitable for the course and its content. I hope they continue to have a Ravens Matrices project in the beginning of the course, but move on to the conversation agent for the second two projects. I think this would line up nicely with the ordering of lectures. \n\nIn the end I'd say I liked this class, but it was far from my favorite.",

The problems were mainly with pacing of the course and specifics with the project details. There were many dead spots throughout the semester and the projects had evolving instructions / descriptions. I expect these issues to be worked out in subsequent semesters. For those who have taken InfoSec, This course is VERY similar. \n\nLots of opportunities for extra credit, some of the projects are reminiscent of Info Sec as well. The class was project based, with each of 4 projects worth 25% of the grade. Up to 10% extra credit was available through an additional project or PT exam. Overall fairly easy to score very well provided you don't biff more than one project. \n\nProjects focused on web security (similar to InfoSec, JavaScript), network based malware analysis (also similar to InfoSec), Network Monitoring (used Snort and Wireshark) and using ML techniques for anomalous traffic detection (no previous ML experience required, Python). \n\nThe slack study group and other students were particularly helpful on Piazza, and the Teaching staff did what they could to help students and generally were responsive and helpful. As is becoming the norm, the Professor was less present as Prof. Lee now has multiple classes running here in OMS as well as the terrestrial requirements at GT. This did not present a problem. \n\nThere is no required textbook, but taking InfoSec first is listed as a pseudo requirement. While it will make your life here very very easy to take Info Sec first, you can probably get through it without doing that if you have a CS background and have ever dealt with security in a job. \n\nOverall I would recommend taking the class. Well done, and plays well with other classes (in its current incarnation).",

Only a few hours of work a week. \n\nLike others mentioned there are only 4 projects that make up your grade. They are not too difficult and do not take up much time. The first is doing a frame busting exploit and creating a Chrome extension/exploit with Javascript. I have never used Javascript before and found it easy to Google what I needed. Youtube videos helped with creating the Chrome extension. \n\nThe second project involved doing malware analysis using some command line tools and Wireshark while running malware in a VM. If you have not used Wireshark you can find some how to Youtube videos to show you how to find data in packets. \n\nThe third was doing some more packet analysis with Wireshark and writing firewall rules using IP Tables. This project along with the first two took less than 10 hours each. \n\nThe fourth was implementing an exploit in an IDS by modifying some Python code. This one took me the longest to do of the four (about 15 hours total) but ended up only being less than 20 lines of Python. Most of it was trying to make sense of what the exploit was doing from reading a couple white papers and figuring out how to code it. \n\nWe had the option to either take an optional final exam or complete and extra assignment for 10% extra credit! You could choose 1 of 3 projects. I chose one that was an extension of the second official project in the class and only took me an hour and about 4 lines of Python code. Another one that looked interesting involved doing a port scan of the entire IPv4 address space for vulnerabilities. \n\nIf you liked the IT Security class you will like this one. The professor and TA’s were very helpful. It is very similar in workload and content and very easy. I haven’t got my final grade but I would guess ending up near 105% with the extra credit.",

I took a Software Design course during my undergrad and as expected this went more in depth than my undergrad but not as much as one would think. The videos were well put together but after the initial assignments did not have relevance to the course. I liked the idea of the assignments taking you through a realistic software design and implementation case. Each assignment built off of the previous one as far as requirement modifications by the client with the final assignment ending with the product that you slowly designed throughout the semester. \n\nI rated this class low because I think the class was harder than it needed to be. There were 3 issues I had throughout the semester: \n\n1. Feedback (aka grades) was delayed throughout the semester. The assignments were ordered as design1 --> implementation1 --> design2 --> implementation2 --> finaldesign3 --> finalimplementation3. The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue. HOWEVER, i will be FAIR and say that instructors were very active on Piazza. \n\n2. Grading was vague and seemed to vary alot between TAs. The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation. However, they did not provide us the test suite they used for the grading until afterwards. This seemed unfair and led to much controversy in the class. \n\n3. I found that most of my time was spent coding rather than focusing on the best design. In fact, UML design patterns were not emphasized at all in this course and due to the feedback we were not sure whether our design was okay until late in the semester. I do appreciate the instructor giving us the opportunity to code a little more but it was almost too much for a course that should be about design.",

That being said, the lectures were fairly interesting, but they also seemed to be taught at a pretty high-level. I feel like I came out of this class with a slightly better general understanding of what they were trying to teach, but I have no idea how I would apply any of it. That being said, the production value of the lectures was great, in my opinion. They were easy to follow along with, and the little exercises kept me engaged (this is my first OMSCS class, so perhaps this is the same for the other classes as well - I don't have a comparison). \n\nThe assignments and exams were all written papers, which is fine with me. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I feel that was appropriate for the material in this course. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you're interested in AI, specifically relating to human thought. The TAs and professors were exceptional (Ashok is a great instructor who clearly has a passion for this subject). However, the slighly disjointed structure of learned material vs. the application of that material left a bit to be desired.

            "text": "For those who use these reviews to pick an \"easy\" course, please note that this course changes significantly from semester to semester, using student feedback, so only use recent reviews. \n\nIn the Fall 2016, we had 8 projects and 3 proctored exams. There was something due nearly every week, with projects of varying difficulty and with tests definitely requiring a good amount of time to study, as they included a lot of \"short essay\" questions, were timed, and proctored (via ProctorTrack). \n\nI found this class very enjoyable because it didn't include a lot of \"busy work\" - most everything we were asked to do led to learning something valuable. The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn't understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many. \n\nI'd say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material. But it is all doable and largely enjoyable. Definitely recommend.",

            "text": "Overall: this class should be called \"how to design and build database-backed web applications. \"\n\nIf that was the name of the class, I would have felt I got exactly what I signed up for. If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this class. As for me, I was a little disappointed that the class didn't cover the design and implementation of RDBMS themselves, only the USE of database management systems to implement databases. IE. we didn't learn anything about how MySQL itself is implemented, but instead we learned a process and theory of how to model data using MySQL, if that makes sense. \n\nI will say, Dr. Mark is a very good instructor. The class videos were great, and the TAs were attentive and helpful. I wish Dr. Mark would offer an algorithms class, I'd love to take that :)\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI see some people said the tests were easy, I felt the tests in this class were brutal. The questions were *very* nitty gritty and subtle, and the multiple choice was usually given so that at least two of the answers were very close to the right answer. I studied at length and still averaged a B on the tests. The project was also a lot of work. I had a good team, which helped, but the grading seemed a little arbitrary. Coordinating with other team members required a lot of time and effort, just to keep track of who was doing what, etc. \n\nSome context, because I imagine a lot of you guys will be in the same situation. I think if you had a traditional CS background and had already taken an undergrad DB class, this would probably not be much new, and that would make it a lot easier. However, I am a self-taught programmer with no undergrad background, so there were a lot of little things about the relational algebra, calculus, etc, that I'd never seen before. This class was a good way to pick up a lot of that \"light math\" stuff, since the practical examples given in the class made it a little easier to absorb.",

Most assignments and exams had multiple corrections made to them AFTER they were assigned, causing frustration as you are trying to work on something that is constantly being altered. Lectures are inconsistent in quality/polish as well as how much material they cover and how well. Some lectures seem to be re-used Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun videos that are nearly unwatchable and not remotely on par with other OMSCS classes. \n\nThere are definitely some bright spots in the course and I could see this being a strong offering later on if they refine/replace a lot of the older and poorly quality controlled content. Assignments were relevant to the course material and did a good job pushing you to learn the material thoroughly. Some assignments even had auto-graders which I appreciated because you could roughly know your grade on the assignment before the submission deadline. To their credit, the TAs were also fairly responsive and willing to admit and correct unclear areas of assignments and exams almost to a fault. \n\nOverall I would still recommend this course as a good first A.

I feel that I learned little, while just enjoying the programming and creativity. \nHowever, the TAs were lenient in grading and very understanding. As a whole, we started to somewhat complain that our midterm and final essays were high level architectures with little value, so they offered an alt-final, where students could develop their midterm NLP chatbot design into a real program, I can't image many other teachers agreeing to offer a second final for students who didn't feel they were learning enough. This really shows the type of education that GT is offering, as well as this class. \nI hope they sort out the kinks in this class, it has the potential to be a great class.",

I agree with this but it wasn't a major headache as I've had similar experiences with other classes. Just know what you're getting into. \nThe APIs are difficult to get set up.

Some of the questions are a bit nit-picky, and some are written in such a way that I spent more time debating the intent of the question than figuring out the answer. \n\nAs for workload, the projects consumed most of the time I spent on the course.

The quality of the new content is amazing, with subtle jokes and animations; the old ones are poorer. Along with the book and lectures there is additional material usually linked to from the week's overview or some assignments, or by other students on Piazza. You might also find more content online; I personally liked lectures from the AI class at UC Berkeley (http://ai. berkeley. edu/course_schedule. html). With practically everyone drawing from the same book, you'll keep running into the same examples over and over again but sometimes having it explained by another person just makes the idea click. \n\nThere were 6 assignments, with best 5 counting towards your grade (worst score is dropped). They require you to understand the algorithms in theory and be comfortable with Python. They usually consist of several parts, starting with basics and progressively diving deeper, offering bonus points for implementing advanced algorithms described in attached papers. The assignments were the best part of the course in terms of learning but at the same time could be very annoying when you're trying to find a bug in a complicated algorithm. It's just not the type of problem you can solve quickly on StackOverflow. \n\nMidterm and final exams starting with our semester were open book.

Even though the assignments were all challenging, the TAs and other students were all very active and helpful on slack and piazza. You can submit the projects as many times as you would like before the deadline, and there are automated tests written for each project that give you immediate feedback on each submission. The projects deal with topics such as synchronization, multithreading, remote procedure calls, and different forms of interprocess communication. There are also often a few extra credit points you can get on most assignments, but usually you need to be to complete the main part of the project before attempting the extra credit. \n\nThere are only two exams: the midterm and the final, and they both cover a lot of material and are worth a pretty large percentage of your grade. Even if you remember all of the material, you have to be able to understand it and apply it in new ways on the exam. The questions are either multiple choice, check all that apply, or fill in the blank. I recommend taking thorough notes while watching the lectures to prepare and asking questions on slack or piazza when you need clarification. \n\nTo succeed in this course, I recommend not procrastinating, especially on projects 1 and 3, and once again taking good notes on the lecture material. Stay active on slack and piazza. Also, it is helpful to get some practice with C before starting.",

I found that if you want to learn the subject, it is a much better use of your time to review the 'optional' reading. \nProject - Based on solving the RPM problems, split into 3 iterations. Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza. The real complexity of this project is not KBAI - it is Computer Vision (they don't allow you to use CV libs yet it's not listed as a prerequisite)\nAssignments - I actually like writing, so these I enjoyed. It is a lot of writing, and I found that looking at the Winston book really helped me learn the concepts. At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don't actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions. \nMidterm/Final - Essentially a more advanced version of the assignments. Our questions were about chatbots, and a metacognition component that could explain our RPM agent's decisions. Fun if you like writing, and they definitely chose good subjects. \n\nThe tragic thing is that this course has so much potential, as the subject matter IS interesting and all over the news. You saw the excitement at the beginning of the semester on Piazza in the active discussions. Those fizzled pretty fast. \nI do hope to improve the course offering they 1) eliminate RPM as a project and replace it with something that actually uses/teaches the kbai concepts 2) redo the lectures to actually teach the material (with proper level of detail)",

I recommend you at least take some intro to c course, and definitely review c strings (and what the str* functions do vs mem* functions), and pointer management, and the difference between c strings and buffers. Those were the gotchas that seemed to get majority of the Piazza posts. \nExams - These were pretty difficult. A lot of gotcha questions as well. You could know the concepts yet still do poorly on the exam. Also the midterm only covered a small portion of the material.... and that left the majority of the material for the final. And that was a lot to study!\n\nNow the best thing about this class was actually the unofficial slack channel. The TAs hung out on there and were so active, always responding to questions, carrying on discussion of concepts... I do wish I run into more classes with TAs like these. \n\nThe worst thing is the amount of people that thought they could get away with cheating in this class. The TAs here spend considerable effort at discovering and pursuing cheaters, on both projects and exams. They take this issue very seriously and managed to catch many. It's unfortunate that so much of their time and effort had to go into something that shouldn't happen, instead of on grading and improving projects. Be a considerate person, don't cheat.",

I learned a ton about how computers actually work, and even though I am a front-end Javascript developer, a lot of the stuff I learned somehow kept coming up at work. Now that I've finally finished, I really want to go back over everything to solidify my knowledge. I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of specialization. \n\nPrerequisites: I wish I had spent more time preparing for this course by learning C better, and doing the 'C for programmers' course on Udacity. I'd also recommend going through the free online book 'OS: Three Easy Steps' (it's pretty short, and there are exercises that go along with it). If you do this, I think you'll get a lot more out of the course. \n\nLectures: With a couple of exceptions, the videos are good but can be pretty abstract. The most enjoyable lectures were the ones that tied into the projects very obviously. You can get away with only watching the videos, but for a fuller understanding you will need to read the recommended textbooks and do a fair bit of googling. \n\nProjects (40% of your grade): I found the first project very difficult indeed, and I think this is one of the reasons why this class has such a high dropout percentage. However, if you can mash your way through project 1, then you should be able to get to the end of the course with a good grade, as projects 2 and 4 are much easier. Project 3 required a few late nights too, but at this point you should be better at C. Start early on P1 and P3, and do not underestimate them. \n\nExams (55% of your grade): The two exams (midterm and final) are short, and while I found the midterm relatively easy, the final exam covered a lot more material and was acknowledged by most of us to be pretty difficult. If you follow along with the recommended schedule (which I didn't), you should be fine. \n\nSlack/Piazza (5% of your grade): Very active/helpful TAs and professor.",

It is the most brutal and most rewarding class that I have taken in OMSCS, and it is the hardcore class I expect to see in a top MSCS program. I personally learned a ton from this course and loved it very much. But be aware of the survival bias. Every two weeks, there were students withdrawing from this class, and only 30+ survived till the end of this semester. \n\nFirst half of the class is about 4 homeworks. Within two weeks, you need to learn new tools, watch tutorials online (in addition to lectures and labs) and finish the coding assignment for each homework. Don't be misled by the difficulty of the first homework, which only takes less than 20 hours of work if you are good at python. Homework 2~4 easily costs you 60-80 hours each. If there were no such intensity, I would not have learned so much in less than 2 months. \n\nSecond half of the class is about a research project on a topic of your choice. Personally, it's my favorite part. At this point, most survivors should be familiar with all the big data tools (spark, hadoop, etc. ) and getting ready for the real meat of this class. There is a pool of topics for you to select, and you are also free to come up with your own topic. Your task is to use the big data tools you've learned to \"reproduce and improve\" a recently published journal paper in the field of Big Data for Healthcare. Given the complexity and shear size of the data, even partially \"reproducing\" other's work is not as easy as it sounds. You can secure a good grade by simply reproducing the result itself. From what I have read as reviewer (you can see all papers of the class), most people couldn't get to the point of matching the published papers. \"Improving\" basically means a publishable work, and very few (maybe 2~3 per semester) can meet that standard. \n\nYou need true passion and serious commitment to succeed in this class.",

There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren't entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn't something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren't until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours. \n\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches. You will have completed some interesting white and black box testing assignments, and you will get a good start on Android development if you have never dabbled in that before. The professor and TAs are genuinely supportive. This is a relatively low-stress way to get back into an academic environment after being out of the classroom for many years.",

Some projects are more survey-like, basically running some commands and writing reports. You need to study the lectures and read papers as well. If you have programming experience, you should be fine to complete the projects. I find it interesting that some people claim they have no experience in python and find coding projects very hard. They probably have no programming experience as well but it does not change the fact that many projects are really not about the programming itself, all programming language uses in the course projects are basic. It is more about the course contexts rather than some language gimmicks. What I really like as well as other courses is that by studying the tests, I am forced to learn the concepts in depth, not just recognize the terms. You have to write essay answers in tests. Overall, it is a good course that covers most concepts of computer networking, especially in TCP/IP, network security.",

The reason that you will love it is because you will employ mathematics like you never did before in real practice. You will hate it because you will see lot of mathematics which requires a very deep understanding of linear algebra. I mean real understanding of what matrices are, not just knowing the definitions or tricks to solve them. You will love professor Bobick and his humor during the lectures. His lectures were very useful to simplify things, and you won't appreciate his excellent explanation unless you try to read a CV book. I must admit, I didn't fully understand all the math behind many topics but I fully understood the intuition behind them. The beauty of this course is that you will have 8 problem sets which will teach the course literally. I enjoyed every problem set from 1 to 8. The only trivial one was PS1, but all subsequent problem sets will require many many hours of hard work. After this course, you will appreciate math and what it can do for you, appreciate ML and will strive to take any course related to it. In my opinion, this reflects the success of this course generally. If anyone want to take this course, then prepare yourself with enough Python knowledge and linear algebra since you will need them. Also, start any problem set as soon as you can and always check Piazza and slack group since you will find great community who will help and encourage you. I'm happy that I've taken this course as my first course since I've learned many great things and it also gave me enough enthusiasm energy to explore more about ML. Take this course and you won't regret it",

I valued working in a group to be able to bounce ideas off others. In the end probably spent 5 to 10 hours a week for the five weeks we had to work on it.

The remaining assignments were not usually as bad. That being said, I got A's on every single assignment, so if you have the time to put into them, you should be able to do well. The assignments consist of both programming and a report. The reports have little writing, but it's a TON of parameter fitting. In some cases, finding the best parameters is harder than coding the algorithms. \n\nLectures\n\nThe lectures were informative and funny. However, there are so many of them that it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. Most of them are not directly applicable to the assignment, so there is a temptation to skip those. I do not recommend that. \n\nFinal\n\nThe final was weird. 15% of our grade, but it was under 40 questions. Most of the questions were not that hard. The study guide given to us covered most of it (though, no collaboration on the guide was allowed). In my opinion, if you found much of the lecture content going over your head, then it is absolutely necessary to study for the exam. \n\nSuggestions\n\nTo me, the #1 pre-req for this course is strong programming skills. Everything is done with Python, numpy, and OpenCV. If you don't know Python, this course could be a struggle for you. I picked up numpy and OpenCV during this class, but any experience with those tools will help you. #2, brush up on linear algebra. Many of the assignments require it. However, you'll find that the assignments explain much of it for you, and the TAs may help you with it during office hours. \n\nSo far, I have also taken KBAI, ML4T, SDP, and Networks. This class was significantly harder than all of those. I got an A, but it took many hours.",

The course is very well organized and provides a great coverage of the full-cycle of the software development from requirement collection to test-driven software development. There is no difficult concept to understand, the challenge of this course is really the follow the schedule and deliver assignment project on a weekly basis. I had no Java and Android development experience before, this course provided an excellent introduction to these two topics. The assignment for testing, i. e., white-box and black-box are really interesting. The instructors did a great job to design the individual assignment, which wraps up the important concepts and techniques of the entire course nicely. To me, the most challenging part of the course is the group project, this is partial due to the time commitment to work together with one free rider in the team. We struggled quite a bit, but in the end managed okay thanks to the generous grade given by the TAs. It would be easier for us to keep track of the course progress if the grades were released a bit earlier though.",

Some algorithms such as Z-order curve will blow your mind. \n\nThe class has video lectures, reading text-books/publications and assignments. The Prof gives guidance on what to do each week, and you must follow that schedule if you want to do well in class. Office hours are held every week, and you must make full use of it. \n\nThere are 5 assignments, all of which are not at easy, even for the experienced C/C++ developer. You develop your project on a VM provided by the class, and then test it on an IBM super-computer, for which you are given access. An initial performance benchmark is provided for most of the assignments and your grading depends on the performance metric. Its better to start the assignments as soon as they are released. After submission, each assignment gets a 48-hour window to improve performance. The class is set up for student to succeed !!\n\nExams are open-book, open-internet, but none of that is of any use if you don't master the subjects. They release previous semester papers, and you should refer to it while reading the class material / lectures.",

In terms of the R programming side of the course, I use R on a daily basis at work so the assignments were a breeze. The projects were cool and make the student think and formulate informed hypotheses about the data. Based on my own grades, I felt like some parts of the project (the second project in particular) were graded too leniently (i. e., some parts where I felt I put \"adequate\" answers, but nowhere near the best answer or result possible, I still got full marks). \n\nThe final was baffling (in terms of the grade I got on it). My honest assessment of my performance was that I probably earned in the 65-75 range, but I was shocked to see that I scored in the 90s. It was very open-ended and I made sure to answer every part of every question, but I do feel like I missed the bar on some of the questions in which I received perfect marks. \n\nThese are good problems to have, I guess (rather than the other way around). \n\nOverall, nice class, and it's unfortunate that Prof. Lebanon (who produced the very nice lectures) will not be continuing as the instructor of record.

In my own experience as a software engineer, it has been sufficient to simply be on the same page as business partners and make sure you understand their requirements. Regular code reviews with senior team members and architects would help to ensure proper code design and quality. I have never once had the need to \"translate\" requirements into any kind of UML diagram. The assignments had a lot of \"busy work\" around this UML and in one case there was even an essay portion to discuss the pros and cons of various architectural styles. I actually found that useful despite it being a bit tedious. \n\nHaving coded in Java for many years between school and work, I found the coding assignments to be a breeze. Having the last two assignments be group projects really didn't help matters. I went all out on the last assignment to make sure the team would get high marks, even though I didn't need them. The last assignment was valued at only 100 points (10% of grade) but I feel like it should have been a lot more given the amount of effort that was required to complete it. \n\nThe lectures weren't particularly engaging and there was a requirement to complete all the quizzes in them to get full participation marks. After the first few lectures that introduce the student to UML and OCL, I didn't feel like I needed the knowledge provided in them to complete the assignments. Indeed, I watched the first two and a half parts, then never watched them again until I had completed *all* the assignments (only to get the participation points).

And it shows. At the end of the semester, a student-run survey found that 15 students learned more on their own versus 2 students learned more from instructions. This is a lost of instructional goal. \n\nThe course composes of 2 unrelated parts. The first part has 4 assignments. The second part has 1 open-ended project. You are assumed to know Python, Scikit-Learn, HDFS, HDMR, Hive, Pig, Scala, Spark, GraphX, MLlib, Zeppelin. The provided environments are versions of both local and AWS Docker containers, and Vagrant images with CentOS, CoreOS, and Ubuntu. This gives a feeling of a kid playing with various toys and can't decide which one to take home. The issue is worse when you find out that the provided scripts don't even work out of the box! It is a lost of focus. \n\nThe open-ended project suffers from many problems. When the assignments are graded based on accomplishments and correctness, the project is graded like an English literature class. You can earn good chunk of points by making a video capturing your presentation skills, even if your project is a complete failure. Yet you don't earn any more point for taking more innovative or difficult approaches than other students. This is a lost of consistency. \n\nThis course is completely lost in the big world of data science. You'll be wandering aimlessly too if you follow this course. \n\nHaving said that, this course would be an easy A if that was all you'd care about. You just simply have to work really hard on it. It is a \"work hard, not smart\" kind of course that loses my interest quickly. \n\nGood luck!",

Instead, there were problem sets which students were free to discuss on Piazza. \n\n- The absence of graded homework assignments was compensated by more exams. Instead of 2 exams, there were 5 exams! However, each exam covered only three weeks of material at a time, so it was manageable. \n\n- There were several supplementary YouTube videos that helped clarify concepts that were inadequately addressed in the Udacity lectures. \n\n- There were several office hours and, unlike in the past, these were available for viewing on YouTube at later times. \n\nIn my opinion the above changes were a big improvement over the previous formats and this was clearly manifested in the smaller withdrawal rate and improved overall grade distribution. The final grade distribution was:\n\nA \t101 32. 0% \nB\t115 \t36. 4% \nC\t10 \t3. 2% \nD\t3 \t0. 9% \nF\t0 \t0. 0% \nW\t87 \t27. 5% \n\nThis does not mean that the course has been compromised and watered down. Rather, by streamlining the content and redesigning the grading criteria, the learning process has become less burdensome and unnecessary restrictions and time sinks have been eliminated. The course content is still the same, so students still have to put in several hours of work. \n\nPersonally, for me, this course was a great learning experience. I took this course by itself so I was able to manage without too much stress. Since my undergrad was not in CS (I have a masters and PhD in Aerospace engineering), I prepared for this course by:\n\n1. Reading \"How to Prove it\" by Daniel J. Velleman. \n\n2. Watching the Harry Porter videos series (based on Sipser). \n\n3. Reading up on the basics of graph theory and related algorithms\n\nEventually, despite not having a math or CS undergrad, I was able to score 97. 33% at the end of 5 exams. So with the right kind of preparation, anyone do well in this course.",

            "text": "1) This course is extremely difficult on very many levels. Though the course name is SAD (D stands for Design) this is course involved too much Code Development. So unless you are GREAT in Java programming (I mean, you need to be a Guru in Java, being good enough just won't cut it) please do yourself a favor and skip this course. Mind you, they don't teach you Java on this course at all. \n\n2) All projects are cumulative which is not a bad thing but they take their sweet time to grade and return the previous projects, so if you make mistakes in the previous ones you carry them on to your next projects. So it is a double whammy!\n\n3) One TA admitted to me that they were instructed to be extremely stringent in grading. Tons of marks were deducted for very flimsy reasons. Regrade requests are entertained but usually doesn't change anything. No motivation to study, correct the mistakes and improve at all. \n\n4) Tries to cover a lot of topics without giving sufficient, valid examples (eg. OCL). And then you get dinged for that (for something you were never taught to begin with!). \n\n5) Absentee professor. Professor doesn't teach this course. He doesn't appear in any of the course videos or lectures and rarely visits Piazza. Office hours are conducted by TAs and sometimes the professor pops in there. In the 8 OMSCS courses I have taken so far, I have never seen this. The Professors always taught their respective classes. \n\n6) Do NOT expect any grade curving. Even if you score 79. 99%, you will get only a \"C\". For some other courses you can easily get a \"B\" or even \"A\" for 79%. \n\n7) As another student pointed out, this course is way out of touch with the real world. I have been a designer/developer for 20+ years now. Never ever worked on any UML translations.",

The instructor was considerate that in some cases a student may have trouble reaching a solution, so for everyone assignment credit is explicitly given for turning something in that shows you had at least put forth some effort. \n\nThe exams were pretty challenging but the grading was fair. They were a mix of multiple choice and short answer. Multiple Answer Multiple Choice questions seem to be a theme throughout many of Georgia Tech's courses. Thankfully in this course they weren't all or nothing. Just be sure to only mark the ones you know or are pretty confident in and you'll likely reduce the damage. For test prep I would suggest focusing on understanding the topics covered in the study guides provided by the instructor. Then you can go over the test prep questions and solutions that were also provided. The professor was good about including the topics you should look over to be successful on the exams.",

In fact even the projects are not too hard, it is the exams I found to be particularly different from all other courses. The exams only have problem solving question with some heavy arithmetic. A lot of practice with formulas is necessary. You not only need to know your formulas but the questions will wrong-foot you at every turn. Hardly in real life we get situations where one has to do HPCA arithmetic within a quick turnaround time. And that is what this course's exams are about, doing HPCA arithmetic within allowed time constraints. Well I am not saying the arithmetic is not important but the course turns it into something like a race at Olympics which I think is not necessary. I would say that if you know your formulas well you can do very well in this course sometimes even if you don't understand the concepts well. In fact a high school student can be taught to use the formulas effectively and be made to do well in this course's exams. I did not like the fact that the course's exams only focus on arithmetic even though it is at a graduate level.",

However, I have a strong math background, and it helped me a lot. \n\nLectures: There are a lot of lecture videos. Toward the end of the class (hw 7 and 8), some of them are not needed to do the hws. However, I strongly advise against skipping any videos (cause you'll need to go through them for the final). The lectures contain a lot of mathematical proofs and derivations, so it might get a little dry. However, Professor Bobick did an excellent job of explaining them as well as the concepts and intuition behind all the math. \n\nHomework: There are 8 hw sets. HW1 is only 4% because it is easiest. Other hws are 11% each. In my opinion, HW2 and HW7 are the hardest (so get started early on these). In general, the difficulty of the hws is not in the coding, but it is the parameters. Getting the code to pass the autograder is not a difficult task. However, you'll have to pick the right parameters to produce the right images for the report (the reports consist mostly images and sometimes, short discussion, not essays). Optimizing the code was also a problem for me because I had no CS background. Overall, I don't consider the homework super-difficult. \n\nOther comments: Piazza and Slack are valuable resource, so take advantage of them. Most of the time, when I got stuck at something, the answer was in one of the Piazza's posts. Also, do watch the Youtube Office Hour videos. The TA explains how to do the hws very clearly and in detailed in those videos.",

I never did the retry question so that I could have more time to work on the required 3 problems for the exam.

I took this class in order to strengthen my understanding of OS's, as I wanted to improve my grasp on fundamental CS concepts. Professor Ada and the TA's were amazing and responsive. Since this was my first semester, this class has set a high bar for my courses as it was very well organized and lectures were quite clear. \n\nAssignments were very helpful in deeply understanding some of the OS concepts we covered. Two of them were time-consuming, and I learned very quickly that I needed to start early in order to succeed. That said, it really helps to be familiar with C before the class; I think a lot of people will agree that one of the reasons why the first assignment is so tough is that many people are learning C in the process of doing that assignment. \n\nThe exams (midterm and final) are tough and cover a wide range of concepts, some of which can get very dense. So again, it is best to start very early when studying for the tests -- do not cram!\n\nThis class was definitely challenging but certainly worthwhile. Grading was tough but fair, and you are set to succeed if you put in the effort, even if you make mistakes along the way. It was intense at times and sometimes stressful, but so worth it.

The projects require you to understand the concepts and make less than 200 lines of code changes(I think we were required to make changes to less than 8 C++ files total. )\n\nOverall it was a very interesting course imo.

Therefore, you certainly need to be able to program a working basic application that will become more complex as it shifts to the group stage of the course. \n\nMy only disappointment with this class is that if you were unsure of a direction you were working towards in your design, you would not get feedback for several weeks which is after the next assignment or two were due. They are very clear that you won't get marks off for repeat offenses in the case you didn't get feedback; however, from a learning perspective, this impacted my ability to learn through the feedback while working on the project throughout the course.",

The topics mostly come from papers published 20-30 years ago but are still relevant (some are the foundations) of modern operating systems. \n\nProjects are interesting but require solid foundation in C/C++. You wouldn't want to spend time familiarising with C/C++ while the projects itself require significant time from design to implementation to testing. Plan to spend at least 30 hours to finish each of the project. At least one project requires you to start from scratch without any template. The good news is grading is quite lenient and often TAs forgive small mistakes or inaccuracy as long as the codes reflect your understanding of the materials. \n\nPiazza is moderately active, questions about course materials are usually answered during office hours. Prof Ramachandran is a very passionate teacher and he monitors closely the class in Piazza. \n\nThe video lectures explain most of the concepts very well, however there are a lot of details not mentioned in the lecture slides. My advice is to print the lecture slides and take notes on the details from Professor's speech. These notes will be very useful in the exam preparation. \n\nThere are tons of papers to read, most of them are the details behind the course materials while some are supplementary. I wish I had more time to spend time reading those papers, as throughout the semester I only managed to read ~30% of them. However if you watch the lectures, you should be able to do ok in exams. \n\nExams are, as others have stated, brutal. The midterm average was 58. The exams require good understanding of the course materials plus *very* good memorisation. Some questions from past exams reappear so don't forget to review them. \n\nThe grade is curved hence the grade will be relative to others'.

It is a shame because the instructor is really keen on making the experience very educational and fun. He has prepared non-required activities where you can probably learn more without the pressure of trying to get a good grade. \n\nWhat I think went wrong this thus far:\n- Unpopular decisions made by the instructor team. Personally I do not mind that much, but it is very reasonable for most people not to like it. And with a class size so big, those small \"mistakes\" have bad effects in high order of magnitude. \n- It seems the grading rubrics are not tightly coupled to the learning goals of the homeworks (or at least what I thought to be the goals are). The most popular \"mistake\" was giving huge deductions for missing complexity analysis in an HW where the goal is to get acquainted with R. Or deductions for not giving actual numbers when calculating those values are just incidental to the HW and the main goal was to visualize those numbers (this one is very minor). \n\nI really hope things turn for the better soon. \n\nThe topics in the course were by the way not what I thought they were. I was thinking more on statistics: hypothesis testing, trend analysis (I think this one will be covered), knowing whether the samples are sufficient, blah blah. Stuff I would need if I want to do research and decide to do surveys, A/B tests, whatever. The syllabus was so short I thought there are a lot more in betweens. Not really, that is it. In the HWs, we were usually asked to give an analysis of results. But I don't really know how to give those analysis correctly, so I end up giving very vague analyses (weakly related, higher, lower). I am yet to see my grade for HW2. The Instructor Team has an aversion for vagueness, so I am not very excited about my grade.",

I was very impressed (and relieved) by the quality of the online delivery system and Piazza classroom forum. \n\nWhat I liked most about CS 6300 is that it differed from your typical boring, textbook heavy software development course that beats SDLC to death. There is no textbook and no exams. Just quizzes and projects. I really enjoyed the projects because they were opportunities to apply course concepts. We learned Git, Android development, MD format, JUnit testing, and so much more! Many of the tools, such as IntelliJ and Android Studio (and even Git), I had never touched before. I learned so many useful tools and concepts that directly applied to my professional work. \n\nAlthough the majority of reviewers rate this course as easy, I caution others not to under-estimate the effort required. I finished with an A but it did require an all-nighter once or twice to meet deadlines and weekly deliverables. Having a programming background definitely helps, especially Java. If you have zero programming background or you're not strong in it then be prepared to suffer a little. The course will not be impossible but I found it challenging enough to meet deliverables because the week seemed to go by so fast between keeping up with lectures, quizzes, and the assignments themselves. I have over 10 years experience developing in C++, C#, Java, VB. NET, SQL, and some HTML and PHP and I felt I was barely prepared. There was still a lot of new learning I had to do and had to do it fast in order to complete assignments on time. I am thankful my group had others with programming experience.

It's unfortunate because I like the topic and Dr. Chakraborty did take steps to restructure assignments, but the overall theme was \"too little, too late\". Also the syllabus is strange - the second half is all basic machine learning, and didn't feel like it belonged, while there was no treatment of visual esthetics - what makes a visualization look good vs. bad, how to style it best, etc. I would wait until this class is much more mature.",

I was very stuck on both thus far, not because it was necessarily difficult but because there was little documentation or little knowledge given to us about the project. On top of that, the VMs and instructions provided for the mini projects were very very poor and paltry when it came to details. I had to scour Piazza in order to troubleshoot some of the most basic issues with the VM (for instance, there was an Ubuntu VM given to us that had no taskbar and had I not known the command needed to use in the terminal in Piazza, I would've just been completely stuck). A lot of time is also spent configuring the VM, downloading files/applications, and installing everything just to begin the project - why the instructors/TAs don't do this themselves and then provide the VM is beyond me. \n\nI would strongly suggest to avoid this terrible class.

It is a good topic, but overall, I wish the exams had more questions so it had better coverage of the material and less \"gotcha\" ambiguous questions. And actually, I wish there were more projects too. Some parts of the class go a long time with simply reading a chapter and watching a lesson. Even smaller projects would be good here and cement the material.",

If you have programmed in an OO language before, this class is a huge waste of your time. Several of the projects are tedious and are of limited value to programming In Real Life. \n\nExample: In one project the assignment asks you to write 30 black-box test cases for \"test-driven development\" - when you have the source code (that you wrote) right in front of you. Actual worthwhile tests that you might write in industry are frowned upon. The standard \"red-green-refactor\" is barely mentioned in one lecture, and never really asked for in any assignment. \n\nGrading is unbelievably slow. Assignment feedback (when you get it) is random and worthless. If you want an easy foundational class, go for it. If you want to learn something useful, avoid. This class made me seriously consider dropping out of the OMSCS program. \n\nI should say something positive. If you've never written an Android app, you'll get that opportunity. The group project is also somewhat enjoyable if you find yourself in a good group (which I did).",

One more project and final exam is remaining. The course starts out easy, first homework is very easy [introduction to R concepts and programming], second homework is moderate [introduction to ggplot2 and data visualization techniques]. The first project was analyzing movies dataset. There were ten questions with lot of subdivisions and each was equivalent to one homework. The third homework is implementing logistic regression algorithm from scratch and optimizing the code so that it runs fast thus enabling to train and test on the dataset given. I am new to ML domain, and the lecture covered in the video was not at all enough to complete the homework, I had to watch the relevant portions in Andrew NG's course to gain the intuition behind logistic regression. It was hard work but at the end, I felt good implementing the algorithm and training it. \nThis course starts off as easy and by the time you realize that the course is taking all the free time you have, it is well past the drop deadline. I would strongly advise students with no experience in ML domain to take this course as a single course. If you want to double up, it can be paired only with courses which are front loaded like the AI4R course. I have put 18 hours per week but that is applicable only to the second half of the course.",

(A lot of people drop in the first two weeks due to poor C skills. Repeat you must already have some C experience !!)\n\nThe lectures are good and Ada know's her shit and does a good job of teaching it. I had almost no knowledge of how operating systems really worked until I took this class and now I have a much, much better understanding. I was taking this class just to fill electives, but it's one of those classes where I was surprised how much I learned (and how much I didn't know). I'm not planning on writing kernel software anytime soon, but the understanding you get from the class definitely helps even if what you mostly do is front or backend web dev stuff. \n\nAs with most other of the challenging course, start the assignments early. The forums move quickly, so if you fall behind your classmates on the programming schedule, your \"I'm just starting part A\" questions will get a lot less attention if everybody else has already moved on to Part C. If you stay up or ahead of the assignments, then the forums will greatly assist you. (My C got a lot better because I was able to stay in the general flow of the class. Had I fallen behind, I don't know that I would have made it. )\n\nSome of the later assignment build off of earlier ones, so design flaws can catch up with you later in the game. You're given very broad scope to design however you like and grading is through an API. I had a design flaw that I didn't understand that bit me on the last assignment in the extra credit sections.

You won't come out of this class writing a basic OS kernel or anything like that. \n\nWhat you *will* gain from this course is an appreciation for how userspace and the OS kernel interact, and a new appreciation for how much complexity is abstracted out by modern APIs that you don't have to deal with. \n\nIf you're already comfortable programming in C, you shouldn't have too much trouble with this class. If you're not, you probably will. The exams (midterm and final) are straightforward but can be a bit picky (i.e. a complicated multi-step calculation that Ada works through in the lecture videos in its entirety, but that you must reproduce on the exam without references), but the course is generous about grade cutoffs (>= 80 == A seems to be the standard) so even mediocre performance on them is not a blocker for earning a good grade in the course.",

More time will be required if you are rusty on your networking skills, as you'll need to read the textbook to catch up on basic concepts. On top of that there is a project every other week, which usually doesn't require much programming, and took me 3-5 hours on average. There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes. \n\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career. \n\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn't involved as much as I'd have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it's a very well run course overall. \n\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying. I also would have liked to do more of the coding on the projects. Except for a couple exceptions, I feel like they hand-held a bit too much (mostly already implemented, you just run them and analyze the results).",

If you've ever taken a math class at the undergraduate level (something above calculus/any rigorous, proof-based course past middle-school geometry), you'll be fine. Get familiar with asymptotic notation and pseudocode syntax, and you'll be just fine. \n\nI have no formal CS background. I took one programming class in college, didn't like it, and majored in math. Later, I learned VBA for consulting, picked up some Java, and got myself a Dev position. And this is my first OMSCS class. But because I've taken math courses before, I've averaged 14/15 on the first four exams. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with how math classes are taught in universities, here's how they go:\nClaim: If [conditions], then [result]\nProof: Suppose [blah]. Then [... ]. Therefore, the claim is true. \nMoving on, \nNew Claim: [Stuff]\nProof: [Other stuff]\netc. \nYou'll get few examples per big concept, which means one or two per lecture. Expect to do most of the puzzling through the implications on your own, though the (ungraded) homeworks help put you in the right mindset and give you practice. \n\nIf you've never taken a math class at the university level, you're going to start out at a loss. Prep. Learn the difference between an intuitive argument (It works for these three examples, so I'm pretty sure it should always work. Besides, it just makes sense, you know?) and a rigorous one (For all objects in this category, equipped with these attributes and arrows, the following holds: [Stuff]. Therefore, in all cases, [other stuff]). Learn induction, contradiction, infinite summation, and whatever else strikes your fancy. \n\nYes, the administrative decisions are capricious and inscrutable, the lectures have flaws, and the Piazza will be devoted to commiseration and scarce on productive advice. There are problems here. But with a little preparation, you'll be just fine.",

If you are registered or waitlisted for this course PLEASE read the Spring 2017 reviews! \n\nThis class has been the worst I've taken in this program. I've rated this class as Easy because the contents are basic and the assignments are not complicated. This course should be seen as \"Learn R by example\". However, having a large class created dozens of different interpretations to the homework instructions that eventually led to great degrees of confusion. I have a perfect score in all returned grades so far and it has been because I've stayed away from Piazza and office hours. I just read and re-read the assignment instructions always thinking what else I would want to see if I was grading this assignment. I know that some will say it is not the student's role but the methodology of going above and beyond has worked well in this program. \n\nOne of the main issues this class had was amount of contradicting information given many times. In several occasions it was mentioned to us that the TAs had a hard time reaching the professor when asked to clarify. \n\nThe staff in this class needs to be evaluated. It was evident the TAs don't talk to each other and a few do not know how to handle students' queries. One in particular tried to seem tough in front of the class justifying their answers by telling everyone that this is GT (I agree with this argument). However the tone and level of sarcasm used in (their) posts came out as confrontational. You are an instructor and if you are part of the team that answers the forums you need to work on your communicational skills! If you are frustrated, take a break and answer a post in a couple of hours or take a walk before answering!\n\nAs a side note, there is a review here that claims the professor was blaming the TAs for \"dropping the ball\", That is not true, it was a TA that said that. \n\nTL;DR: Wait for this class to be reviewed by GT!",

However, writing exploits (buffer overflows) and doing cross-site request forgeries, cross site scripting, sql injections - how cool! I havent written a line of C code in 25+ years, so learning some C and learning to use a C debugger would be helpful. I recommend starting early on the projects. Appreciated the optional extra-credit project. However, I didnt have time available during the semester (with the workload of 6300 and my job) to dedicate time to them. So, at the last minute I submitted half of the optional project 2. 5, and believe I got a few extra points to help the class average. \n\nDO follow the assignment instructions. I lost 10 points on the first assignment for placing an exploit file within my writeup, and the instructions said to attach it separately. My bad!\n\nI learned a tremendous amount in this course. Although there was minimal if any interaction with the instructor, the TAs were more than involved, had access to him (and in one instance interceded on my behalf), were highly knowledgeable and available daily. And, until the last project I didnt realize they had chat rooms during their office hours where we could get help when needed. \n\nI do have another security text I purchased a few years ago. I found the Stallings text to be an awesome asset to one's library. The book was great, and I feel was a key to the tests and quizzes. The second half of the class, given my overall daily workload, I was not able to keep up with the reading, and am cramming for the final. \n\n\nTo me, this should be a required course for anyone in CS. I look forward to taking the network security class.",

Regardless, the lack of timely feedback and consistency of assignment clarification led to a lot of unnecessary confusion. I'm all for an appropriate level of confusion regarding course content, as that's called \"learning, \" but this semester was a logistical mess. Props to Adrian Chang, our TA who went above and beyond in grading, Piazza responsiveness, and overall engagement. Tough to do for 500 students, especially when the prof was frequently absent or seemingly unreachable. \n\nRegarding curriculum only (in hopes of logistical improvement for future course iterations): I don't come from a math background, and could have brushed up on calculus before enrolling. I thought this course would be more focused on visualization principles. There was some ggplot experimentation with project 1, but it's mostly about using basic ML models and R to analyze data. Glad to get a first taste of logistic & linear regression, but am pretty convinced I don't want to use R or ggplot ever again.",

The projects were great and I watched all the lectures. But the quizzes, the exams, and the reading just did not help me learn at all. The hard part about the exams is that you really don't know where questions are coming from... quizzes? book? lectures? projects? all of the above?

They really helped me understand the material we were learning and I felt like I was able to really grasp some of the fundamental aspects of software security that I was missing from my undergrad. Since I had a computer science background these projects weren't too difficult. You'll need to know: C, Python, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. \n\nThe only other comment I have is that the TAs/Instructor didn't participate in Piazza as much as I would have liked. It made the whole semester feel disorganized. For example, the instructors didn't post anything about the first exam until 2-3 days before it opened. Makes studying pretty hard. They also didn't post anything about the final. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and learned a lot from it!",

This is not a bad thing, I actually liked this approach, but since its my first time, a lot of time spent is to learn to think in terms of ML. I read all the papers and most of Tom Mitchell's book - prescribed by the TAs. They are very useful to understand these concepts. One thing is assured - all this effort will not go to waste. Its rewarding because now I am able to appreciate what ML is all about. The only draw back is the course focus is not on implementing algorithms. But ofcourse if time is spent implementing them, then less time would have to be spent talking/discussing about them. In the past I have taken Andrew Ngs Cousera course on ML, ML4T and DVA. While all those courses are good in their own way, CS7641 really dives inside the different ML algorithms. For those interested in pursuing ML this is must take.",

I had completed half of the labs prior to taking the course and have taken all other ML / data courses in the program, so the machine learning and general data concepts weren't extremely challenging. The catch, though, was trying to drink from a fire hose in order to complete the homework assignments. The challenge w/ the assignments was picking up Scala, working with provided virtualized / containerized environments (for Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Zeppelin, etc. ) that weren't fully functional or compatible with the requirements of the assignment. Get ready to troubleshoot the tools you're given. \n\nThe instructor and TA were not at all very interactive on Piazza. IF we got an answer, it was often not necessarily answering the question given, wasn't complete, or so general the question needed to be asked again from a few additional angles. Many times there just wasn't a response. We completed our final project submissions and hadn't received feedback on an assignment submitted about 1. 5 months prior... most recent grading feedback was 2 months ago. TA office hours were non-existant... really were \"message the TA and hope for a response\". The prof' did host a couple opportunities to have a brief chat session to discuss the project, but this was about it. \n\nScala is nice now that I've done it, but was a bit of a paradigm shift for me, so work on it ahead of time. Aim to complete all of the labs prior to the beginning of the semester. If one could hang with the class pace of assignments for a little over half of the semester, then the 2nd portion was dedicated to an individual/group project and was much more tolerable as you could select/control the technology and environment to work within. Also, as w/ any course w/ a team project, vet a good team early. \n\nYou will pick up a lot of pertinent technology, but will work for it (find help early).",

However, along with each assignment, we had to complete a lengthy PowerPoint report. The report templates contained many relevant questions and topics to respond to, but there were also numerous \"busy-work\" questions as well, and we had to go into great detail for each question in order to get full points. \n\nOn the topic of \"full points, \" the grading policy was the worst part of the course. By completing all requirements in a single homework assignment, the max possible score was a 90/100. In order to get any portion of the last 10%, we had to go \"above and beyond. \" The requirement for this was extremely subjective, so maybe this was a decent idea in theory, but it didn't work very well in my experience with the class. In addition to this, the grading/late policy just generally had no flexibility, and it punished all students equally, regardless of whether they were truly lazy/incompetent or just busy with another work/life issue, which is likely more common with OMSCS students compared to on-campus students. Perhaps it was fair in a way - it just seemed overly harsh to me. \n\nALL that being said, the course was a ton of fun, and it was a great way to brush up on Python/numpy skills. It was somewhat more time-consuming than I anticipated due to the long reports required for each assignment, but it was generally easy overall, in my opinion. \n\nIf you're at all interested in photography or image computation/manipulation, give this course a shot. Hopefully the grading policy will get an overhaul at some point, but it's definitely manageable if you put in some extra effort.

The examples in the lectures were so contrived and just kinda weird that I didn't feel interested to explore the readings or any other resources in more detail. \n\nThe projects were all about solving Raven's Progressive Matrices which got really repetitive. In the end, I felt like I was trying different hacks to solve the problem, without actually using any KBAI topics. There was also a lot of writing, which didn't really help my understand of the subject. \n\nThey did try something new with alternate projects this semester (building a chat bot), but the project was too open-ended and was not defined well enough for me to attempt. Perhaps this will improve in future semesters.",

You will write ~13, 000 words throughout this course. \n\nThe projects all revolve around solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices.

There are plenty of resources out there on getting up to speed with it. It's worth overcoming that burden sooner rather than later. \n\nThe lectures are pretty high level and they only apply for the writing assignments. \nOverall this is a theoretical course so there aren't a lot of hard lines for anything. It leaves a lot in the open for you to think and go your own way. This can be frustrating for some people as students in general like hard lines as it gives us something to measure against. \n\nThere were parts of this class I didn't like, but overall it was a solid class.

            "text": "WORKLOAD:\nThis class consists of lecture videos, two exams (midterm+final), one \"quiz\"-type project, and three C-programming projects. The programming projects are based on 1) socket programming, general C, and multithreading, 2) IPC, and 3) RPC. The first two projects were sizable endeavors, and the third was much less intense. I had very little general programming experience (no industry experience, some C++ in undergrad, and some Python scripting). The first two projects took me about 50-80 hours each, I'd wager. \n\nTESTS:\nThere is no required text for this course, and all you get for material are lecture videos and papers. So studying for tests consisted of watching videos over and over for me. The tests themselves are kind of vague, but they are achievable, and you will learn a lot studying for them, but I would like to see more concrete test questions with less subjectivity. One \"project\" was a take-home quiz, where you decide on test parameters for some fictitious experiments. This one was super vague, and I would have much rather actual ran experiments and written a paper. \n\nLECTURES:\nI don't know if this is true about all OMSCS videos, but she waves her hand a lot in front of the screen, which causes the text to be projected on her hand. Not a big deal, but I found this distracting. I ended up watching the lecture videos over and over, because that seemed to be the best way to pass the tests. Would rather have been pointed to more reading. \n\nOVERALL:\nMy first course in OMSCS. I think this class was great and was not too hard, even without much programming or OS experience coming in. You'll learn parallel programming, scheduling, file systems, memory management, IPC, Linux, systems programming, etc. You touch on some concrete Linux examples but I would have liked more.",

            "text": "This was some of the densest material I’ve studied. The lectures were interesting, but so packed with material that it was difficult to absorb. Grade was determined based on 8 problem sets (partially auto-graded), peer feedback, and a final exam. Thankfully, the problem sets supplemented the material quite well, and helped me to understand some of the math and concepts that were discussed in the lectures. Even so, without a fantastic TA (Pedro) who hosted office hours every week to talk about issues in the problem set, this class would have absorbed much more time. To get over a 95% on the problem sets, you had to put in some work to show going “above and beyond” what was assigned. Typically, this took the form of an additional “challenge problem” in the assignment. These problems usually were parameter-tuning extensions of the original assignment, but could take several hours to complete. I should also note that several assignments required some amount of parameter tuning, which some find tedious and boring. While this may be true, it does accurately reflect the nature of the field. \n\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class to take. I felt I learned a lot of applicable material, but also felt like I had not absorbed most of what was discussed in the lectures simply due to my time constraints (also took CCA and ML4T this semester). Like most classes, you get out of it what you put into it.",

While it was neat to learn some Pandas and see the application of ML to the stock market, much of the ML application didn’t come until the latter third of the class. I’ve taken 9 classes in this program, and this one was the most disorganized that I’ve ever taken. Assignments were typically changed within a week of the deadline, submission windows were not open in a timely manner (in a couple of cases, only two days before the deadline), and Piazza was so noisy it became difficult to differentiate posts of actual substance (which may be credited to having 500 students in the class). Assignments often took many weeks to grade, and made it difficult at the end of the class to gauge if I needed to attempt the extra credit project since 36% of my grade was unknown. It was nice to have a utility that could run automated tests, but it ultimately had no effect on the project grade. This class could benefit from a tool like Udacity’s Bonnie to grade student assignments and return grades in a timely matter. Dr. Balch and the TAs were somewhat responsive on Piazza, but they disappeared towards the end of the semester. Overall, this is a class that should be taken prior to ML as a sort of introduction, due to its low workload and introductory material.",

Choose your teammates wisely and finish phase 3 coding early because there is an exam and extra work in the form of sample data (3k lines of SQL inserts in our case) and a demo to prepare at the end. Phase three of the project is primarily graded via the demo where you checkout the code from github, load the sample data into MySQL and walk through the demo via Bluejeans with a TA in 25 minutes or less. Check the schedule for your semester, and if its the same, yes, finish coding early. They are not kidding about the importance of practicing the demo. Recent topics like NoSQL and big data are not covered, yet. As mentioned by other reviewers, Prof. Jay Summet was very engaged on Piazza.

They also give you a week to complete the exam so there's no real studying for it and you should expect to spend 10-15 hours on it.

I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that. \n\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty. \n\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems. They were not handled in the best manner. Piazza became out-of-control negative. Communication from the professor was often sparse. CIOS feedback should be given to avoid this in the future.

Project 4 required you to be able to read or write HTML, JavaScript, and PHP, but having only minimal familiarity with those I was still able to figure it out, so I wouldn't over-stress about those. \n\nThere was a ton of lecture material for the course, which got tiresome. In particular, the videos for the first half of the course are extremely long-winded and even at 1. 5x or 2x were quite repetitive. \n\nMany of the quiz questions are lifted verbatim from the textbook. Because of this, many students found a searchable soft copy to be convenient. I had a hard copy of an old edition and it was definitely adequate. \n\nAlthough I was successful on the exams, they didn't feel like especially high quality assessments. The projects were certainly a superior source of learning. \n\nThe most disappointing part of the course was that there was virtually zero instructor presence on Piazza or office hours. Luckily a couple of the TAs were helpful via Piazza or available for consultation office hours and peers were helpful on Piazza. I got the feeling on Piazza that students who struggled on the projects would have appreciated a lot more guidance and instructor participation. Since it seemed the TAs were in charge of designing and managing the projects, it left me wondering what the instructors were actually contributing.",

            "text": "This class was phenomenal. I haven't taken any ML courses before, and this seemed to serve as a good intro. The course is divided into three modules - basically numpy applications to finance, intro to finance, and machine learning (with a focus on finance). \n\nThe ML projects were the most work. It sounds like based on feedback, one of those projects was moved mid-semester rather than the end with the rest to attempt to distribute the workload a bit more evenly over the semester, which I thought was effective. Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I'd advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around. Typically around a week before the due date there are some final modifications to the project requirements, which although annoying tended to be fairly minimal. I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course. Only once were these changes extremely substantial and disruptive (for the biggest project, no less), but all things considered I think this course was very organized and made it possible to start projects much sooner as compared to other courses I've taken. \n\nThe second to last project was a huge amount of work for me, but the rest were a manageable level of intensity. The projects largely build on each other (most projects reused code from previous ones), so it's essential to stay on top of them. \n\nThe instructors and TAs were generally friendly and very active on Piazza. There was around a week near a critical deadline where they vanished which proved to be quite frustrating for many, but in the end I think being very active 15 out of 16 weeks vastly surpasses the quality of interaction I've found in other classes.",

A few of the projects could be huge time sinks, and could easily take 40 hours. The lectures were excellent, but to truly appreciate them, you need to at least skim the suggested readings. I personally loved reading the papers; they're entertaining, like war stories between the good people and the malicious hackers. The quizzes and the optional final exam were straightforward. I had no problems with the grading, and thought the TAs were patient, helpful, and fair. \n\nHowever, some of the students in the class were some of the most entitled I have found in the program. These students complained and demanded a lot. There were numerous requests for due date extensions with the given excuse of having full time jobs and families.... The problem is that probably 90% of us were in the same situation, and yet we still got the projects done on time. A few students missed the final exam, and blamed the instructors for the \"non-standard\" exam window. Are we in a graduate school here? Piazza was extremely noisy, and a lot of students offered opinions that caused much confusion. Academic integrity violations were rampant: students shared (partial) solutions on Piazza, discussed solutions and included code in their postings, or provided hints that reveal way too much information. TAs had to delete code from some posts, but it's not clear if the students were disciplined or not. \n\nIf you take notes during lectures, do the readings, and work on the projects carefully and independently, this class takes about 15 hours/week. But, if you don't, and simply post on Piazza asking for hand holding on every single difficulty that you run into, or wait until last minute and simply follow the \"walkthrough\" that would be inevitably built up on Piazza, then yes, this would be an easy class that would take 4-5 hours/week.",

The tests felt a little bit luck-based -- did you happen to remember one sentence from one of the dozen research papers you read? If yes, it was easy. If not, then impossible to guess. I don't think the tests did a good job judging whether you'd learned the big picture or even the majority of individual topics discussed, rather they seemed mostly a sample of minutiae from the papers which you may or may not remember. \n\nOne big warning, I think they've revamped this course in the last semester or two, because it was fairly challenging (especially the tests) and took a decent amount of time each week. There's some kind of project or test almost every single week, so you really don't get much of a break. \n\nPast reviews indicated this class was easy. I don't think that's true anymore. I'd say this class is relatively *tractable* in the sense that if you can put in the time to memorize all the papers you read, and put in enough time on the individual projects, you have a very good chance of earning an A.

Some of the projects can be huge time sucks while you basically guess and check to find an acceptable answer. \n\nOn the negative side, I found the lectures very poor, like watching a video of someone reading flash cards. They contain frequent \"quizzes\" where the quiz itself is the instructional material. These aren't recaps of anything that is covered elsewhere, it's guess-and-check until you can match a bunch of terms (which you may never have heard of) to their definition, or the exact short answer they want to a vague and open-ended question. The next segment of the video will of course, not discuss the terms you just learned, but move on to something else. It's basically like having wikipedia read to you. \n\nToo often this class felt like going on a tour of the chocolate factory, being quickly rushed from room to room and being told briefly what the machines are called, then having the warning labels read out loud to you.

Mid-term and final exams tested concepts from the lectures, were straightforward and fair. There were no trick questions. If you paid attention during lectures, took notes, and spent the time to understand the concepts, you would do exceedingly well (I scored in the 90%s for both mid-term and final; it can be done!). In fact, for a couple questions in the final exam, the answers were directly in the lecture notes, and so you could literally just copy and paste!\n\nThe lectures were excellent and provided all of the (basic) fundamentals to work on the assignments, and you would fill in any gaps by reading the required readings mentioned in the assignment instructions. Again, if you took notes during lectures, and did the readings, then the assignments would feel straightforward. This doesn't mean that they were easy, but at least you wouldn't get entangled in the concepts, and would instead be able to tackle the \"puzzle\" head on. The documentations on the libraries/frameworks/tools were sufficient and clear. \n\nIn summary, this is an excellent class on static and dynamic analyses. In addition to the application, it covers theoretical aspects: does an analysis terminate; is it complete; is it sound; can we do better, and if so, what the trade-offs would be? You will learn a ton, and end up with a deeper appreciation of static/dynamic analyses--the sort of things compilers and IDEs do to optimize/analyze your code.

But I acted like they didn't exist except the few times I had a specific question, and I suspect my learning suffered for it. \n\nThe lectures comprise the bulk of the learning material, along with journal articles assigned for most lectures. Most of those aren't too difficult, skewing towards older and easier to digest articles. Ada's a great lecturer and I have few complaints about the quality of the lessons. The recurring \"toyshop\" metaphor felt like a gimmick and wasn't particularly edifying, however. Some of the topics chosen were a little mysterious -- it's unclear to me how remote procedure calls, for example, are a good topic for an OS fundamentals class. \n\nYou'll spend most of your time on the projects. If you know any C at all they shouldn't be too difficult... though through a combination of poor planning and lapses in intelligence I couldn't figure out the synchronization necessary for Project 3 and received an extremely low score. Avoid my mistakes and start early. Each of those projects should be an easy A, if you're careful with your time and ask for help. \n\nThe tests, on the other hand... There are two and they jointly account for 55% of the grade. They are also pretty tricky IMO, so take 'em seriously. Also make sure you understand and can work out the problems from the lecture quizzes that need to be done by hand, some of those will surely come up. \n\nAll told I'm glad I took the class. I'll likely get a B, but if I'd applied myself a little better an A would have been achievable. More importantly, I've grasped the fundamentals well enough to have a base for continued learning. Edit: ended up with an A. My course grade was ~81, to give some idea of curve generosity.",

Attending the office hours were very useful. The head TA at the time, Michael, really saved this class! The professor for the semester was really hands off. It appears she was mostly busy with other things and so we didn't get to see her much (she didn't hold weekly office hours). \n\nNote that the papers will take time to read and comprehend so if you're taking this class, try and get ahead of the readings.

Participation points literally rains on you from the surveys, Piazza participation, and even peer feedback (similar to KBAI). A side effect of this is that some of the peer feedback you get is pretty much generic. There are some really useful ones though so keep an eye on that. \n\nThe class's Piazza is really active and Dr. Joyner is quick to reply there and on Slack as well. Your mentor may be a hit or miss. My first mentor was great and we had lots of discussions on my research topic at the time. If you form a group, you get assigned a new mentor and that's usually the mentor that most group members have (if there's one or is random otherwise). My group's mentor was really hands off (as in I actually got 1 personal communication the entire time he was assigned). We didn't hear much from him throughout the entire project and our team's grades was always late. \n\nThe class allows you to research/work on a project that you want as long as its related to ed tech in some sense. There were some really interesting projects and I believe group work here helps a lot. While most of the time group projects are kind of a bane, this is one of the classes where it can really help you come up with something that you'll never be able to going at it alone. Just MAKE sure that your group mates are as interested in the idea/project as you are. I had a really great group but found out late that one person in the group was just bandwagoning and the work produced by that person really showed the lack of interest.",

All assignments had 1-2 weeks to complete and I was able to get most done in ~ 2 days (and I have very little experience in Java). \n\nThe exams are more than fair: first, provided practice exams do well to prepare students for the actual exam; second, the exams are open-notes; finally, there is nothing tricky about the exams and the questions were entirely reasonable. Follow the lectures, take some of your own notes, keep a copy of the instructor notes handy, and run through the practice exam, and you should have no trouble with the midterm/final in this course. Study for the exams earlier rather than later. The instructors (rightfully, IMO) do not answer questions about course content during the exam window, so if you wait to start studying until after the exam has opened, you may find yourself unable to get help if you're stuck. \n\nFinally, the instructors/TAs for this course were excellent. They were readily available to assist students, from Piazza to Slack to Office hours. They were courteous and respectful to students, extremely fast with grade turnarounds, and overall ran the course better than just about any class I've taken so far.

In general I ended up studying all the material for a very long time only to spend 5 to 10 min on each test. The testing on ladder logic was not done well since there was no effort to give partial credit. This I feel is important when testing knowledge of a programming language. \n\nThe projects were the best part of the course, but still fell short of providing that much challenge in the class. The actual tasks pertaining to the material were quite easy, but sometimes it was the preparation that took the longest. My feelings after taking the class were that homework should be given each week to introduce the students to the technologies they will be using, like VirtualBox, Wireshark and the ladder logic emulator. Therefore the projects could involve more of the class material and less learning about the project environment. \n\nLastly, TA involvement on Piazza was good. They were there to answer questions or concerns.

ML4T consists of three mini-courses: (1)numpy and pandas, (2)hedge fund and stocks, and (3)basic ML methods (regression, kNN, decision tree, ensemble models) and reinforcement learning (Q-learning). \n\nStudents may find certain sections easy or hard. For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction. \n\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn't require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642. \n\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments. \n\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn't bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks' questions.",

I came at this course after ML and RL, and have had previous experience in the securities industry, so I found this course pretty easy, but not without its challenges. \n\nThe good: The material is really interesting, and Prof. Balch is incredibly enthusiastic about the topic. You get an opportunity to implement some ML algorithms from scratch, and you learn a lot about the markets. Personally, this course is where I learned how powerful and useful Pandas and NumPy are. \n\nThe bad: Really, only one thing -- the assignments are subject to change as late as a week before they are due. Usually the changes only require a few minutes of work to implement, but it is frustrating if you are the type of student who likes to move things from to-do to done as soon as possible. \n\nI believe this course would make a good first course in the program. It's a gentler introduction to machine learning than 7641, and teaches some skills that will prove useful throughout the program. The finance knowledge is also fascinating.",

The grading was inconsistent, the TAs were frequently combative, and the instructor's solutions to problems were frequently terrible. \n\nOur final exam appears to have been written at the last minute. Out of 35 questions, 3 were on material not covered in the course, 3 had issues that caused the instructor to admit they were bad, and 2 had multiple correct answers. To make up for these questions, the instructor added 3 points to everyone's score and then refused to take any grade challenges. This solution is unfair and took many students from an A to a B gradewise. I was fortunate to not be one of them, but this class is the worst run class I have experienced out of 9 OMS classes - I am sorry I took it!\n\nThe on-campus course this spring looks like an amazing course, dealing with lots of big data technologies. Instead, we got a basic introduction to R, which I hope to never see again - it's that poor a language choice. This class really should be taught in Python and should cover more relevant topics like the on campus course.

I have a paper that is close to being ready for publication that I do intend to submit this summer to its intended journal. Since there's currently no research track available in OMS, this class was a welcome bit of research. I'd love to see more classes like it if not a full research path available for OMS students!

There are really no lectures outside of a few at the beginning and then any others you choose to watch while trying to land on a research topic. \n\nThere are papers you must write during the initial research phase as you narrow down your topic. During the project phase you must do weekly check ins and two milestones. The final project is a paper formatted for journal publication, the actual project (paper or prototype), and then the actual files/research you used. \n\nI personally chose to do develop an actual prototype. I was given free reign to pick the platform and the features as long as I could justify them.

It was an easy A for me but I would rather have had the class be more challenging and actually learned more--I don't feel like I learned much beyond some very basic Machine Learning concepts. \n\nThe professor and most of the TAs were mostly absent from Piazza and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of response from them. The instructions for the homework weren't clear and it was difficult to get anything clarified. The TAs would tell us something and then the homework would be graded the opposite of what they had told us. TAs and professor would contradict each other all the time. At the time of the final exam, I had only gotten back my grades for HW1 and HW2 (out of 3 homeworks, 2 projects, and some additional extra credit activities). This was frustrating since some of the questions on the final were related to things we did in the homework and projects, and when I wasn't sure if I had done those things correctly I thus wasn't sure how to answer the questions on the final correctly. \n\nI got high scores on the homework and projects but I have to wonder if it's just because there was such a backlog of grading to do close to the end of the semester that the TAs just rushed through it and gave almost everyone As. I'm guessing at least half of the class ended up with an A, especially due to the extra credit--it may have actually been closer to 75%. \n\nI was hoping to learn a lot about data visualization but it was mostly just a tutorial in how to use ggplot2 and a short discussion of the different types of plots one can create. The lectures were very shallow and general--I wish there had been more of them. It was probably only about 6 hours of lectures total for the entire class. It just felt like it wasn't enough, and it also felt like the professor (who was NOT the same professor as the one in the lectures) didn't really care about this class at all. \n\nDISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The approach that the class takes on exams is to get you to take your knowledge to the next level, rather than testing what you learned directly. This could be a good thing or a bad thing; depends on how you look at it. \n\nThe assignments are okay. Their goals are really exciting (parallel list ranking, the N-Body problem, distributed communication collectives, TeraSort, and funnel-sort), but I thought the instructions were a bit lacking. I'd say I spent 40% of my time trying to understand the skeleton code, another 40% learning about the goal of the assignment, 15% coding, and 5% learning things about C. \n\nWhile working on the assignments I found myself more stressed out and frustrated than focusing on putting my knowledge into practice. However, they're continually improving this course, so I anticipate that this will change in the near future. \n\nI do feel quite accomplished after finishing the course, and for what it's worth I took this as my first course while working full time, plus my wife and I had just had our first baby a couple of months before the class started, and I was able to pull off an A. So if you're up for the challenge, then I say go for it, you're learn some really cool stuff.",

This course covers more math than many other courses so be prepared for that (ref:http://omscs. wikidot. com/courses:cs6476). The problem sets are many(1 introductory & 7 advanced... kind of) and can be pretty tough. Thanks to Pedro (TA) for breaking it down for us. I've completed 5 courses so far & have not come across another TA more helpful & passionate than Pedro. I'll credit him as much as Prof. Bobick for this course. \nYou'll learn a lot on fundamentals of CV, it's applications. You'll definitely learn a lot of Numpy tricks & openCV. \nOverall an excellent course if you are aiming for CP&R specialization or in general curious about CV",

But, the readings are great if you have time to read them. The topics are relevant to today's cyber security environment and also covers recent research in this area. Some papers go really in depth in the topic like how DNS works, etc. You also learn to use machine learning to check for network anomaly and then to bypass it which is cool. Assignments can be annoying since they require specific answers to the questions. Some assignments took more than 40+ hours to complete due to this. I suggest instructors to make the assignment more flexible and grading flexible too. If you want to learn in this course you will (provided you do the readings and assignments) and if you want to just pass it you can (but may not learn much!)",

If you're coming in with some knowledge of Python and Linear Algebra, then I would say you can put it in 10 hours per week, get most of the knowledge out of the class, and walk away with a solid B. But if you're really going for an A, then you'll find the class taking up a lot more time. The grading structure is designed such that each homework assignment has an \"Above and Beyond\" section that counts for 10%, so to get anything higher than a 90, you'll need to develop something beyond the basic requirements of the assignment. Personally I enjoyed this a lot, but it's clear that a lot of others didn't. \n\nThis class is being redesigned over the Summer, so I don't know if any of this will hold true in the Fall though. Overall I had a great time, but for the future I hope the instructors make the writeups shorter and the coding more challenging. \n\nEdit: Also definitely do the readings! They are absolutely fascinating! But don't worry about fully understanding all of the math for each reading - you just need to get the gist of them.",

For me, this also meant that I was unable to fully absorb lots of the concepts. The lectures are just \"ok\" in my opinion. In many sections the math is glossed over, which was a bit disappointing. \n\nThe \"Above and Beyond\" portion of the grading seemed rather arbitrary and subjective to me. For one assignment, I didn't even attempt the extra 10% and inexplicably got a 94 on the assignment. On the other hand, there were other assignments that I put 8-10 extra hours in and only received 1 or 2 points. Overall the process was extremely variable. Lots of it seemed like it depended on the TA you got and what mood he or she was in that day. \n\nMy biggest beef with this class was the final exam. This was unproctored and open-everything. This sounds great, but in practice it meant a bunch of questions with tricky wording. Even that wouldn't have been bad, but tricky questions were combined with poorly worded questions, making it hard to determine a question's intent. The final basically devolved into a digital scavenger hunt. I don't think it measured my knowledge of the material at all-- just how well I could use Ctrl+F. \n\nOverall this was a decent course. The homework is interesting and can be time consuming, so possibly try to take it on it's own.",

After taking one of those famed \"Baptism of Fire\" courses in OMSCS as my first course, this course was very nice in helping me gain back some confidence. \n\nFun Factor: Very High. The applicability of finance and trading (which I also have some personal interest in) made the ML concepts stick just that much better. \n\nI put down 10 hours / week, but it's really more like 4-5 hours a week - potentially even less if you already have extensive python experience. Much of the time was spent fooling around with the people on slack (whose experience and camaraderie, I was told, was probably never to be repeated in the history of OMSCS slack channels). There were extracurricular contests going on to optimize code, etc. that sucked tens of hours each week. \n\nProfessor Balch and a number of the TAs were ever present on Piazza which was very helpful. \n\nLike most other OMSCS classes, the #1 killer is procrastination. Many folks were apparently caught blindsided by some schedule \"squeezes\" that were not anticipated. Also, some folks were seemingly blindsided by not carefully reading the assignments.

Grading is nonsensical at times, you may get contradictory feedback like \"You should have talked about X... \" followed a sentence or two later by \"I see you did mention X... \" and yet you will still get docked 20% without good reason. You will be told things like \"You don't need to memorize formulas\" and \"You won't need a calculator\" for the exam, and then the exam will expect you to have memorized a formula and do the formula calculations by hand or in your head without a calculator. The grading curve is complete nonsense, you can \"fail\" by traditional standards and still get an A in the class. The assignments will not come with complete expectations in the requirements, you may get some more of the requirements by bugging the TA's during office hours but it is still not guaranteed. If you ask for an example of what is expected you will be told \"No, because then you might parrot the example\" and the professor wants you to \"be creative\" except that the TA's will penalize you for missing something expected in the hidden grading rubric that they wouldn't tell you about or give you an example of.

Class was well run and the grade distribution for projects and test was done fairly. Only thing I did not like was the extra credit for discussion threads where many people added fluff that didn't contribute to learning just to gain extra credit and half the time others feeling like we didn't have much to contribute to the value with all the 'noise' in those discussion threads. Otherwise I would highly recommend this class. I learn't a lot and it was a good introduction to the program!",

I still had to go back and watch lectures for a few questions, but having structured notes made it easy to quickly find that specific lecture. \n\nEach week had individual assignments which usually take 3-4 hours if you want to do a good job and earn an A. There are word limits, so leave no word unturned and revise, revise, revise to fit that word count! Taking notes for all the coursework can be really helpful in your written work because you will need to refer to the concepts you learn in the lectures. \n\nThere is an individual project that you can complete over time, or within a week if you dedicate a few hours a day to it - I did feel a bit rushed to complete it before the deadline. There's a team project, and of course, YMMV based on the strength of your team. Be ready to learn how to write surveys or perform interviews, which can be challenging if you are lacking in soft skills!\n\nOne of the more interesting experiences you'll have with Dr. Joyner is that this is very much an \"open standard\" (not necessarily \"open source\") course. When students post feedback about the course structure, or something that didn't work quite right, Dr. J is extremely forthright about how he might change or improve the course. Since user-centric design principles focus on receiving feedback to inform iteration and continuous improvement, it's no surprise he does the same for his courses.",

            "text": "The summer schedule seems incredibly compressed. The first 3 assignments & the individual project were doable with the 1 week/submission schedule. However, the second phase of M assignments go through a complete cycle of a UI design, from needs finding to prototype construction and evaluation. Almost all of these all require input from an external group: either friends or family or the other students for the need finding and review activities. The same has to be done, this time in a group context for the group project. A little more time is allowed for the group project as it only has to be in at the end of the semester. \n\nThe logistics of that into a forced march of a 1 week cadence make this unworkable for me to integrate into work&school&travel. \n\nI think if one is able to dedicate a non Summer semester to this alone, it could be doable. But for Summer, I think the course workload is unrealistic. Just too much logistics which detract from the content. It would be better to have a single project, with enough time to get all the reviewers logistics organized and submit towards the end of the semester. I don't think it's necessary to have a group project. Any advantages from a group can be had from allowing students to review the various steps, and better yet, be able to incorporate that feedback into your work. (The way a real review at work would be used). \n\nBTW one disappointment is that in order to have a project you can use at work, you need to submit an application to an IRB of some sort. Again this throws in a logistical detail, as something like cannot be organized within a week, yet, that's all you have if you keep to the 1 week cadence. Without some incredible foresight or preparation, the whole thing is unworkable for a custom project. You basically *have* to take a play project, and use your fellow students as the users. \n\nBBTW I seem to be writing about a different course than the people below, perhaps the assignments were reworked?",

Although the first few lectures covered that material, the course then proceeded toward compiler-level analysis of source code. This was not what I was expecting/wanting from this course; I previewed the remaining course materials and decided that this course wasn't really going to be applicable to my interests/career. I've decided to withdraw from the course. I'd say that this course is more oriented toward OMSCS students whose background is in CS and compilers rather than a software engineering type. I thought the lecture material was fairly dry, and failed to provide much context for the concepts and algorithms being presented. I completed the first 3 assignments and felt that they were somewhat useful in reinforcing the concepts taught in lecture, but I spent most of the time trying to read the (generally sparse) documentation for the tool. This summer (2017), the instructors provided excellent midterm preparation material for the midterm exam, but the exam was still challenging (took me 2 hours to complete of the 3-hour window). I thought the grading was strangely harsh for some relatively minor errors (my opinion) in homework submissions. \n\nI feel like the course kind of hangs you out to dry on the assignments in terms of support. The lectures cover the concepts, but the assignments are basically \"Read the manual for this tool, and implement stuff. \" I've taken enough well scaffolded courses to know that this is not the best way to teach people (throwing them into the deep end). \n\nTL;DR: Overall, I was disappointed in the content of the course, since it didn't really focus much on software testing but mostly low-level analysis most suited for compilers. If you're into that type of thing, this course may be for you. I ended up withdrawing from the course for these reasons.",

TA is very prompt, rarely let a day pass with unresolved piazza questions, with clear concise answers. \n\nProgramming projects! Not for the faint of heart. Implemented either in C++ or Java. No starter code. As I understand, the summer version of the projects is a bit different than Fall/Spring which included more compiler phases but with starter code. Be very well prepared with one of those 2 languages. And explore data structures, you'll need to use lots of sets, vectors, stacks,... etc as well as structs. Projects can be done solo or in teams of 2, but we were strongly advised to work in teams. And having taken the solo option and spent tons of time to keep up with this choice, I recommend you find a team mate unless you're an experienced programmer. \n\nThere are 2 projects, the first is a front-end project where you implement a simple scanner, and implement a parser generator and an LL(1) parser. The second project was much harder, where you implement 3 methods of register allocation on IR code and convert the code into assembly, and simulate the assembly using SPIM simulator. \n\nThere were 4 HWs, that take a bit of time, pen and paper work, but they were excellent in measuring how well you undrstand the material. \n\nThere's a final exam, haven't taken it yet, but it should cover the entire syllabus. \n\nAs I remember Projects: 35%, HW; 35%, final exam: 30%\n\nPerhaps the only con would be the absence of an auto grader, and being given basic tests to try our code against, you will have to devise your own tests, otherwise risk failures with the grading tests. \n\nHighly recommended.",

I definitely did not come in with any RL knowledge at all.

Who has the time to read 3-5 academic papers a week and absorb the content? I understand maybe 1-2, but to ask students to read 50-100 pages a week is a bit much. \nHomeworks not useful. \nNo coordination between HWS and Projects. HWs usually prep you for a project. This is not the case at all in this class. They are almost a unnecessary distraction. \nProjects were graded on how accurate can you reproduce a paper. I think this type of grading is poor, considering the people that wrote the paper, have usually have significantly higher qualifications then an OMSCS student and probably spent a couple months creating the results of the paper where OMSCS students have around two weeks to hack around and get the same results even though yes the equations are in the paper but they take a long time to understand and figure out. \nTA office hours not helpful. \nLectures need to be cut down.

The problem is it's really meant for folks right know with a basic knowledge of RL versus none.

            "text": "SHITTIEST COURSE! A BIG WASTE OF TIME & MONEY. \n\nThis is not a Master level class. It does not teach you how to think, analyze, or reason with logic. Instead, it asks you to memorize concepts, protocols, and several shameless plugs from the instructor. \n\nDon't let the first few videos fool you with that hard yellow hat or the substation in the background into thinking the instructor is passionate about the class. On the contrary, you rarely see him participating. There was a question from a student and he condescendingly answered \"I'm not going to debate with you but for other students, my statements were right. \" That surprised and roiled up many students. If there's anything you'd learn in this class, unprofessional attitude is surely one. \n\nThe remaining of the videos are paraphrases from books, with a bunch of fundamental errors sprinkled in for taste. You're expected to remember all of that, including misinformation. \n\nThe mini projects (i. e. homework) are ill prepared. Unlicensed Windows, outdated software, non-working environment, etc. These issues were reported in earlier semesters but none bothered to fix them. The staffs just don't give a f*ck. And the previous sentence is my only review about the staffs. \n\nThe exams, as mentioned before, expect much rote-learning. But questions are badly written. In a true/false setting, most questions can go either way depending on the (missing) context. There is no way to reason them out, even security pros fail to match the answers. The final is especially terrible. Scheduled for ~3 hours, many completed in ~3 minutes. This class obviously does not meet any educational standard. \n\nTo recap, taking this class would set you back a few steps on your way to a good job. There are better security classes in the OMSCS program. But please do take this class if learning-by-rote is your kinda thing and you want to sell security to your boss. This class is easy and has enough spins for that.",

I tracked the time I spent on this class down to the minute, and spent an average of 9 hours a week watching lectures, doing assignments, or reading Piazza. This is definitely a class where you'll get out of it what you put into it. There are extra reading assignments that you can do (for fun), you can interact on Piazza about questions offered up in the videos, and Dr. Joyner really tries to facilitate student interaction on Piazza. Also, these videos were by far my favorite in the program (out of 10 classes taken). \n\nThe assignments were generally pretty straightforward writeups that were directly correlated with the lectures. We learned and went through the design lifecycle over the course of 5 assignments (1 assignment/week). While parts of this felt a little rushed due to the need to get outside participation in surveys or interviews in a week's span, the assignments themselves were light (~1000 words), yet informative. This class provided a glimpse into what it looks like to iterate through the design lifecycle with a focus on user-centered design, which I felt was informative and necessary for creating high quality solutions to problems. \n\nI would be slightly concerned about a lack of rigor during the fall or spring semesters, when students have 6 extra weeks to move through the material, but I guess there is plenty of room to perform needfinding to a fuller extent or create higher fidelity prototypes. Even so, I would assume this would be a relatively light class, and could pair well with a more time-intensive class.",

The professor runs the lectures of the course nearly directly from a technical book, with his preferences emphasized. It sometimes feels more like a survey of a wide range of industrial control topics with an emphasis on the power grid. The problem is that it's a poorly written book in both language and conceptual layout. For example, you find repetition of facts at the beginning, middle, and end - but all high level concepts without specifics. \n\nTechnical papers the professor wrote were more interesting than anything in the book, and I wish the professor focused more on his work instead of the book - \"Industrial Network Security\". There was a little bit of opinion/politics thrown into a couple lecture - and this is my ultimate pet peeve. \n\nNot too much detail on most topics or specific technical challenges like you will find in nearly every other OMSCS course. Two of the three projects allow for a slightly deeper dive, but still not what you would expect from your average GT graduate course. The instructor did post a few things throughout the semester on piazza, but TA involvement was puzzling. Although the TAs do answer random questions, you definitely get the feeling that the TAs have a lot better things to do than answer questions on piazza. Even with that our TAs still really seem like great people, and I liked them. \n\nThe hardest part of the course is having so few grading events. There are two tests and three projects. And the tests are not long, so you have to make each grade count. \n\nI write a review for every class I take, and this will be the first negative review for any class. That probably speaks to the strength of OMSCS. It's not a BAD class, per se, but it does not stand up to many of the others. And that's a pretty high bar.",

If you are looking for a class where you can have meaningful discussions and really dig into the material, definitely pass on this course for now. \n\nProfessor Lee never communicated with students a single time. When a project was shut down when students got emails from GA Tech Cyber Security telling them they were violating institute policy and potentially federal law, there was silence. When the final project was based around a paper he authored and questions were posted regarding both practical and theoretical application of the concepts, there was silence. The instructor could have been listed as \"Mickey Mouse\" and the student experience would have been the same. \n\nOther instructors were not much help either. If you have a question about something in a project writeup, be prepared to be told to re-read the writeup ad nauseum or to literally beg for clarification on Piazza and then get ignored. Expect cryptic or poorly-worded responses from instructors buried in random threads with no further clarifications provided, and private posts to go unresolved for entire project windows. One TA did hold weekly office hours and actively participated in Slack and Piazza, but it just wasn't enough. \n\nStudents were also limited in their ability to help each other, despite the lack of instructor participation. Trying to give hints or troubleshoot led to one occasion of instructors threatening students with honor code violations. Solutions to past projects were also deemed off-limits due to the fear of withdrawn students hiding on Piazza to learn the solutions.

The problem is that the course is a long, extensive enumeration of a bunch of things that you should memorize (snooze-triggering videos on the details of various protocols used in industrial control systems) and then the exams do a very poor job in measuring the extent to which you've absorbed that information. So what's the point? I hate courses that function like a laundry list of concepts to memorize, but if they can't even write unambiguous exam questions based on that list, the course is garbage. (Additionally, the lectures are just a condensed version of the book readings, rendering the readings redundant and unnecessary. ) The projects were poorly explained and there was much reliance on the student Slack channel for project setup (hint: project setup is like 90% of the work for the projects). To top it all off, the instructor was either unengaged or condescending. The course is technically \"easy\" in terms of workload and subject matter, but I would imagine that most people got B's just due to there being few grading events that don't measure your understanding very well. I just finished the final in less than three minutes, having settled on an end goal of getting over half of the T/F questions correct for a B (the A being unattainable or not worth it due to crap questions).

However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don't require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked. Definitely do a team for Project 3, and study extra early (read Probabalistic Robotics, and read on your own, don't rely on the lectures).",

With 6 homeworks, 3 projects and a final added on top of 20+ hours of lecture and 25+ papers to read, it's a lot of content for an 11 week (really, nothing much is available the first week, so 10-week) semester. \n\nThe TA group was top-notch - the best group of TA's I've encountered. \n\nThe projects were challenging, but fulfilling to get them done, similar to ML in that respect, but definitely a lot more hands-on. Also, you are expected to both write a short (3-page) paper and complete a short (5 minute) video presentation for each project. \n\nThe homeworks can be hit or miss. Of the 6, 3 were somewhat time consuming, and 1 of the 3 was extremely time consuming, however that may change in future semesters as they have been adjusting the HW to move towards a more auto-graded style. 5/6 were auto-graded and the one that was not was the extremely time consuming one. \n\nThe final exam is challenging, but fair, in it's current format. This is speculation, but given the expected 2 weeks to study in a normal semester, it would likely have felt a bit more manageable to review all of the content. \n\nOverall, I thought the course was worthwhile, but it is definitely not one to take lightly with regards to workload or effort required.",

Apart from that.... \n\nThings that I did not like about TAs is that they did not play any role in guiding the folks into the right direction or helping them out in understanding the concepts better. \nOffice Hours were not help at all and, I gained nothing from those, they laughed at queries asked by people and what not, did not discuss the prior submitted assignments as if the folks who did not get those right, will get to know about their mistakes eventually (didn't allow us to share anything on piazza regarding submitted assignments post deadlines as well). At one point I really thought, if you know it then you got it else drop the class and that was the worst feeling ever. \n\nNote: I have seen TAs doing better and great job in order to help folks and in making understand assignments better in other courses e. g. CV (King Pedro rocks!!). \nFelt like Miguel, Tim and Chris were the only TAs who were proactively participating and other TAs were nothing more than project graders. \n\nI read somewhere in below comments that TAs were as busy as we were but I don't understand what made TAs busier than us as Hws were autograded and only thing that TAs were busy with Project grades (as well finals and HW5) and just one office hour per week (ignoring the 2-3 hands on session given by Miguel/Chris). Moreover, that was part of their job to support all these activities. \n\n6 TAs joining same Office hour per week, could not understand that thing. I think that was waste of time for most of them as mostly Miguel and Tim drove those oHs and they could have divided the hands on and query sessions among themselves and could have provided more value to the folks like me. \n\nIn the end, I am satisfied with what I learned from this course but if it were not for my peers, I would not have made it this far in this course. \n\nHappy Reinforcement Learning!!",

The class felt like it was just run by TAs who (mostly) had no clue. The was really only one exception, which just wasn't enough to save this course. However, my complaints about this course are as follow:\n\n1. ) The lectures were mostly terrible. On occasion, there was an OK lecture, but by and large they were far too shallow to be useful. \n\n2. ) The projects were riddled with problems. Very often, issues with the projects would be figured out deep in the comments of Piazza and there would never be an update or an announcement to the class that the problem was found, so if you didn't read /everything/ in Piazza, you were probably running in circles. \n\n3. ) The professor delegated nearly everything to the TAs and the TAs were /terrible/\n\n4. ) Grading was cryptic and ridiculous. Forgot the \"www. \" on a URL even though you verified it wasn't in the packet? Doesn't matter, that's 1% of your final course grade. Got the solution working 90% of the way? Oh, that's a 0 because nowhere did it say it was all or nothing, which translates to 5% of your final course grade. TAs had to regrade nearly every project and it was like pulling teeth to get them to realize their mistakes. As well, they never released the answers, so we just have to trust them after all their fumbles. \n\n5. ) I learned nothing. I think the longest project took me 6 hours and the shortest about 2 hours and it would've been very easy to do each one without watching the lectures or reading the papers. \n\nThis class has great potential, but in its current form it's absolutely terrible. In hindsight, I wish I had taken anything else or nothing at all. Steer clear, if you can. If you can't, try to take this in the fall or spring. I feel like doing this over the summer semester made all of this class' shortcomings more obvious.",

I believe there were only 2 projects for Summer 2016 - we had 3 projects, 6 homeworks, and a final for Summer 2017. This meant something was due every week, with projects due every 3 weeks. \n\nI'd say this course in the summer is at least as much work as ML in a full semester, if not more. I wish I had taken it in a full semester, as even doubled up with another class I think the slower pace for the projects would have been extremely helpful. \n\nRegarding the course overall, I liked it, but not as much as I was expecting to. The lectures were great, the volume of expected readings was overwhelming, and I have mixed feelings about the projects. I really enjoyed the second project (Lunar Lander), where we used cutting-edge RL techniques to solve an OpenAI Gym problem. The first and third projects were both replicating results from papers, and I found I don't enjoy that very much. I think it's a valuable skill to have, but the emphasis was too heavy on it. My ideal would be to keep the first project as a paper replication project, but replace the third project with one similar to the second (where we read papers to learn the techniques and apply them to solve a challenging problem). I actually quite enjoyed the material the third project focused on. \n\nI also didn't really see the point of submitting both a 3-page paper and a 5-minute recorded presentation (with an exception for project 2, where it was neat to be able to show videos of my agent playing Lunar Lander). I think this is a common complaint, as the TAs polled the class on our preferred submission format, so I think this might change going forward. \n\nOne last thing, Dr. Isbell was almost completely absent from Piazza (I knew from reviews here to expect this, but it's a big departure from ML). The TA team was exceptional and did a great job of running the course, especially Miguel and Tim, but I wish Dr. Isbell was more active.",

If you prefer a more structured course, you may not enjoy this course, however if you like to work on a project that interests you personally and have a ton of creative control then you will enjoy this class. \n\nI would suggest having a rough idea of what you would like to do for the project going into the course. However if you aren't sure, educational technology is a pretty broad field and the first few weeks are spent researching various topics in the field to help you brainstorm ideas. \n\nAs far as grading and workload, the expectation is that the scope of the project itself will be about 100 hours. This amounts to 10-15 hours of work each week. You should be able to earn an 'A' if you put in the time and communicate your progress (even if you end up behind your original schedule). Difficulty is really how familiar you are with the work you do for the project, and since you choose what to work on you can control how much you want to branch out there. \n\nTaking this course over the Summer is tougher but do-able, you are looking at a few extra hours a week due to tighter timelines.",

The ONE open-ended part of the class was to be weekly discussions on Piazza with the prof. These never happened. More on that below. \n\nIt was very poorly run. The prof (MK) never showed up after the first week. Not once. This might be OK in another class, but it meant that we didn't get any of the open-ended, research-oriented interaction promised in the syllabus. It also meant that the TAs floundered. They kept saying, \"I emailed the prof and I'll let you know what I hear. \" On the rare occasion the TAs were able to reach the prof, she made more false promises about when she'd show up. Prof hung the TAs out to dry, along with the entire class. The TAs made effort for the first half of the course, but by the end, most Piazza questions about the material went unanswered -- even the ones asking for guidance on errors in the test prep materials. \n\nThe exams were multiple choice and T/F with lots of ambiguity. In higher education, there's often some ambiguity, and you write about it and address it. In a multiple-choice exam, however, there is no opportunity to address the ambiguity! The tests are written using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, and I never knew whether I was overthinking a sloppily-written question or if it was a trick question. Both types (sloppy and trick) are on the exam. I managed to do pretty well, but that was by careful deconstruction of the test author's psyche. Or guessing. \n\nRead the papers, watch the videos, and follow the tutorial projects like a monkey. You do need some skill turning basic algos into code, and luck on the exams.",

Video wise I learned much more from the freely available db classes on youtube (by stanford, peirce college, and houston clear lake). The exam questions were more tricky than than a test of knowledge (thus the difficulty rating). And no one in 2017 is going to need that much in depth knowledge about calculating index size. A unit on some of the new db trends (ie NoSQL), would have been time much better spent. Or maybe an actual case study of redesigning a problematic db application. \n\nThe class project is more about application programming than anything to do with db architecture and design. The db architecture and sql required were rudimentary imo. The programming, while not advanced, was extensive. Much larger than the db piece. Heaven help you if you get a bad team-- the group project will be a nightmare. Make sure everyone on your team has some level of programming experience. \n\nBEWARE the phase3 of the project. It's graded more about how you do the demo and programming than ANYTHING having to do with DB design and architecture. Even if your app is bullet proof be sure to conduct the demo in such a was as to go through the instructions ONE BY ONE calling out where your app meets the description. Don't count on the TA to ask you about anything you may have forgotten or been nervous and overlooked. \n\nAnd yes, as stated by the other reviewers, the class was tight and well run, the instructor (Jay) very attentive, knowledgeable, and responsive in piazza.",

The TAs were poorly organized and communication was extremely limited - there were so many unanswered, critical questions on Piazza. \n\nThe professor for the summer didn't even show up once. We were waiting for announcements that never came. The TA's favorite saying was, \"I'm still waiting to hear back from the professor\". \n\nThe test grading was absolutely ridiculous - the final was 30% of your grade and it was filled with multiple choice questions where the possible credit per question was 0, 0, 20, 60, or 100%. (5 multiple choice options, and any incorrect selections subtracted from your credit. This was true whether it was supposed to un/checked although the claimed purpose was to \"prevent people from clicking every option\" so not checking a box that was supposed to be checked still gets you marked off, which was stupid). So if you got 4/5 choices correct, you got 60% credit. 3/5 got you 20% credit. So stupid. \n\nThere are a TON of papers to read that have no relationship to the course except that the exams ask questions specific questions about them. \n\nI feel like too many people before said, \"This class is easy!\" so the professors/TAs decided to make things stupidly hard. I got an A on the final because I studied my ass off. I don't understand the need for rote memorization on things that don't matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course. \n\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews about the class being unorganized and I thought, \"Oh, they've got it figured out by now. \" No. They don't. Don't take this class.",

The assignments were painful in terms of having to work through incorrect or ambiguous instructions. In some projects then there would be a comment in Piazza that clarified something or corrected an error but that would be late into the project and in some cases meant repeating the project. It also meant that you had to spend a lot of time on Piazza, not just reading every post once but going back to see if an instructor had added a comment at a later date. I spent a lot of time re-working the projects which I feel was time wasted. For one of the projects it is still ambiguous as to why we had to do something a particular way and it has not been explained despite several attempts at asking. \n\nIn addition one project involving zmap Internet scanning resulted in many students being flagged by the IT department as performing unauthorized Internet scanning. This is something that should have been cleared with them in advance by the professor. It left students unable to complete the assignment, although they were given an alternative quiz afterwards it was very poorly handled. \n\nIn summary it is an interesting course and I did learn a lot from it, but the projects were very poorly handled in terms of incorrect instructions and ambiguities.",

The course material itself is interesting - If you don't know in detail how internet works and nothing about traffic engineering, security issues, what is a cluster etc this is a good course to learn. It assumes you know undergrad networking knowledge (which i do not have) so there is a bit of learning curve\n\n2. Second project is difficult - You need to know algorithm for this. I did not know and got 60/130\n\n3. Lectures - My goodness this is the most difficult part. Content isn't bad but delivery needs improving\n\n4. TAs- My class TAs were amazing. held the courses together and responded fast and with respect. Kudos to Kelly Parks (head TA) and other TAs with her. \n\n5. Professor - Promised discussions for extra credit but didn't deliver. Gave 5% boost to everyone at the end but you could have just said you were going to do that from the beginning. Not sure why you had to make everyone anxious until the last week of the class\n\n6. Exams - Only multiple choice. Not sure why it was formatted like this. It was helpful to get your grades fast but I would have appreciated bit more free form answer discussion. I guess the classes were too big? not sure\n\nOverall not a bad course if you want to learn about networking. I do wonder what the opportunity cost is though. You should think about whether you REALLY want to learn networking or not. If you think this is a blow off class like it used to be, it's not. Prepare to put in 10-15 hours of work",

The lectures themselves are pretty barebones with all kinds of discontinuities, jumps, and quizzes that don't always make sense, but the lectures do adequately cover the core materials. The assignments are relevant and I found them doable (but then I lucked out and found an easy solution for the infamous \"frame buster\"). I enjoyed playing the \"black hat\" and defeating machine-learning intrusion detection systems and aggressively probing network hosts. \n\nThere are few things more important in practical CS than network security, and so this course is something of a missed opportunity.

I felt those started off well and 2 of the TAs did some hands on sessions, which were great. However, they lacked consistency and did not engage in depth with the students about theoretical concepts, which would have been very useful. Questions were often ignored or not completely answered. It's great to have so many papers and resources to absorb but to have a discussion about it and how the student/TA interpreted the material would have facilitated learning even further.

The course requires a fast and consistent pace to keep up with the homework assignments and projects; I would not advise having any vacation or work responsibilities that take you away from the course for more than 2-3 days at a time. It definitely seems like this course has gotten quite a bit harder over time, as the workload indicated by the early reviews were quite lower than what I experienced. I would put this one and ML (7641) at roughly the same required time commitment, though RL is more focused on implementation and achieving a certain result, while ML is more focused on analysis and writing. \n\nPros:\n--Interesting material that really covers the seminal developments of the field\n--TAs do a strong job managing the class\n--The fastest grading I've experienced in the OMSCS program (tied with ML)\n--The autograder for the homework assignments was helpful. (You'll want to max out the points on homework to offset the inevitable point losses on the projects and final exam. )\n--The projects are interesting and challenging, with the second one being the best. \n\nCons:\n--No interaction at all with the professor\n--The style of the lectures isn't concise and sometimes sacrifices the content for entertainment. Tighter scripting would be helpful. (Many others, though, love the style. )\n--The oral presentations for the projects seem pointless. I never received any feedback on them, and they seemed to have no impact on my grades. \n--At least for the summer, there is a short window (less than a week) after finishing the last project to study for the final, which covers the whole semester. \n--Feedback isn't very detailed, and the specific point deductions for the projects and final exam are not revealed. \n--Just keeping up with the homework and projects can leave little time for reading the assigned papers",

It is unstructured in the sense that there are not formal video lectures throughout [there are several introductory videos from Dr. Joyner on Udacity you'll watch in the first week, but that's it and even those are informal]. The rest of the course involves researching educational technology and proposing a project which you'll then complete while working with an assigned mentor. However, it is structured in the sense that you'll be guided through a series of objectives and milestones along the way. Discussion on Piazza plays a big part too... basically every day, there'll be some suggested topic to discuss or debate, although everyone is encouraged to ask questions, share articles or other interesting content they've found and just generally join in much as you would in a traditional seminar course. The TAs and Professor were extremely responsive and involved, but they also managed to stay out of the way and avoid micromanaging. The style of individual mentors varies as you'd expect but they make an attempt to match you up for a good fit and I had no problems working with mine. Finally, peer reviews are also included.... my impression of the utility of those was mixed. In all cases, various sorts of 'participation' are acknowledged and form part of your final grade. At the beginning, you'll probably wonder \"What have I go myself into ?\" but before long you'll find yourself fitting into the flow just fine. Your communication skills will definitely be exercised... there are weekly essays prior to actually beginning the project phase, milestone & progress reports, a final project video presentation, and a final project paper suitable for publication. Time management is also important, particularly in the compressed summer semester. Bottom line --- you'll get out of it what you put into it.",

It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them. \n\nThe course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted. \n\nOverall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors. \n\nThe Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class.

As a professional software developer having built some POC/crude mobile apps, I used this opportunity to use a framework and toolset I have always wanted to try but never had the time or project-idea that combined led me to actually investing the time to learn and develop the application. This class gave me that flexibility with some rigor through a proposal with a timeline and ultimate deliverable with the flexibility to adjust as needed. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this class for anyone who genuinely is interested in exploring the intersections between education and technology and is interested in either developing content, doing research, or developing an application to add to the community. The flexibility to do a more research based approach versus a development approach is something that I think most people will enjoy about this class. Simply explore, learn, and contribute. \n\nAlso, the professor is very engaging and constantly is a resource to contribute and inspire conversations.",

Many of the videos were too theoretical for my taste (focus on things like algorithm convergence, etc), though as usual the instructors make a great team and are entertaining. There was a strong focus on technical papers (a large percentage the instructor's own), and I generally find them an awful way to learn new concepts. The 1st and 3rd projects were replicating results from old papers, which was tedious and dull - I don't think I learned much from them. Project 2, which used an openAI game was amazing and made the entire class worth it in my book. The TA's did a great job, but at least for summer session there was essentially no instructor involvement. I'm still somewhat glad I took it for the overview of some of the cooler topics, but if you really loved Machine Learning's practical focus, you might be disappointed with this class.",

I probably watched 30% of the lectures but read all of the course slides and that turned out to be enough. The quizzes provided in the lectures are the worst I've ever seen. Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don't evaluate what you've learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don't pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project's specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn't do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As. The lesson here is just do the work and start early on the projects. They are not extremely difficult but they do take time so don't underestimate them. I would break my workload estimate down to ~6 hours of project work and 2 hours of viewing lectures and reading papers.",

This means so long as you got a full mark (not quite hard to achieve) in every assignment (accounts for 60% in Summer 2017) and don't bomb the midterm or final (accounts for 20% each), you're good. \nThe lectures will get you intrigued about major AI topics, but certainly won't make you some AI juggernaut. What on earth is AI anyway?\nOccasionally, you need to write your own unit test for the assignments. The XYZ_test. py files they provide weren't perfect - let's put it this way. \nTAs are trying their best to be helpful with their delightful sense of humor. In most cases I waited for 24-48 hours before a TA addresses a question I posted on Piazza. There were complaints about absence of TAs, so I'd suggest them hold daily mentoring sessions instead of just 3 times a week for summer terms (perhaps less frequent for spring/fall since it's less intense). People got frustrated by unclear expressions in the assignments and exams. \nUnlike other courses I've taken, the instructor was almost absent on Slack or Piazza.

Projects were really awesome. I did all the projects very well. I was able to relate the practical aspect of the Network Security via projects. One project was really challenging one. I had to scan the whole world wide Internet using university supported infrastructure and processes. The last project was really cool. I had to read the research paper and implement the python code to evade the Intrusion detection itself. I also got good reading material for Bit coins. On down side, auto grading kept me in tension till l last minute.. Also, many fellow students were appeared to be super smart. They were also very helpful.

I'm fighting to get the grades uploaded, and they've been out for about 5 minutes, and you can't wait for me to finish before you start asking questions?\" That sort of emotional outburst and unprofessional behavior was common.

            "text": "This was my first course in OMSCS, so please take this review with a grain of salt. I had no Python experience, but lot of programming time (10+ years) in C and Java. I am also an amateur photographer and very comfortable with a DSLR camera. This course comes with a weekly assignment which is to be turned in every Monday leaving very little breathing space. As this was my first course, i had signed up for only one course and was able to spend atleast a day or two for the A&B (Above and Beyond) section. For many assignments (7-8 of them), lot of time is spent on research and report writing. The TAs shared some of the exemplary reports for each assignment and it was ridiculously amazing at the amount of work being put into them :)\n\nThe first 2-3 assignments are pretty simple and straight forward, though few of them requires setting up equipment (Camera Obscura), taking loads of pictures (Photos of space, feature matching) and few assignments have specific coding requirements (HDR). We get two weeks for the final project and the final exam is an open book multi choice test. \n\nOne of the best parts of this course is the auto grader for the coding parts of the assignment with Instant feedback and unlimited submissions. \n\nFrom discussions over slack, few had paired this course with another course based on the earlier reviews and faced difficulties due to the assignment schedule. \n\nCheck the Course Google group for insight into what kind of assignments were worked upon. Good luck!",

I think this course could serve as a good introduction to C as well as operating system fundamentals, and it's not that hard to get an A despite not having experience with C. \nMy background - technical undergraduate degree (non-CS, a little programming), web developer for 3 years using higher-level languages, and read 'The C Programming Language' as I was starting the course. \nExperience with the course - this course requires a decent time commitment, both for projects and for keeping up with lectures. Most weeks had 3-4 hours of video for lectures, and I worked steadily on projects every week, making sure I kept up with recommended benchmarks so I didn't fall behind. Not being familiar with C meant that I did a decent amount of googling for basics (and referring back to my book), and I also requested help [moderately] often from the slack channel. However, most of my problems were not strictly due to lack of language familiarity (the homeworks do not demand anything that complicated in terms of C) - more often I was confused about the concepts or made silly mistakes due to lack of confidence. The TA's are extremely helpful and responsive, and other students were helpful too. I believe there was also an introduction to C office hour held at the beginning of the course (but I did not attend).",

Once the second project started things changed, probably 20-30 hours a week for the rest of the semester. The second project hadn't been assigned as mandatory before and it was not really ready to be released. There were a lot of issues with the descriptions and grading of that project. Hopefully it will be smoother in future semesters. The final project seemed impossible at first, but if you just experiment with things you have learned in this class (or other classes) you will find you can achieve decent results. So my two pieces of advice for the final project:\n1) Write a good script to test with. This will really help with #2\n2) Experiment with different approaches. Just try things. Overall I implemented 5 approaches and fine-tuned the best of those five. \n\nLectures: Not many lectures, only 6 but they were of good educational quality though some of the in lecture quizzes had a bit of disconnect from the instructions given in the \"intro\" video for the quiz. \n\nHomework: You have a homework set for each Lecture. The answers are given during the lecture so you should be able to get a perfect score here. (30% of your grade)\n\nProjects: As noted above the first was pretty straightforward. The second was pretty hard and a bit of a mess for our semester at least. The final project can be done in groups if you want, that might help with my advice above about trying different approaches. I went solo and got a good score. (Projects are 20%, 20% and 30% of your grade)\n\nI believe our professor said the class is being handed-off to a new instructor next semester so things could change...",

Includes a group and individual project. The group project can be either very easy or very hard depending on your group - in my case, it wound up being incredibly time consuming (>40 hours one week because I had two absentee group members). I wouldn't recommend taking this course in the summer for just that reason - I don't think they scale the project back for the accelerated schedule, and one bad week of coordination can tank your schedule. \n\nThe lectures are informative and well-done. The professor and TAs are very involved with the class, and I'd take another course from Orso in a heartbeat. \n\nIf it's been a while since you've worked as a software engineer in a modern environment, this is a great course. If you're like me, and have been one for more than half a decade, it's probably less valuable.",

I'm aware that my background definitely helped a lot, so I hope this review could be helpful for people with a background similar to mine. \n\nThe main skills needed for this class are:\n- Experience on Linux CLI, environment variables, how to install packages/libraries, etc. Also knowing how to use a Virtual Machine. \n- Some background in Machine Learning: what cross-validation is, typical metrics, how to train a model, and how to run predictions on it for supervised and unsupervised methods. \n- Experience working with data in both databases and structured files: SQL, aggregation functions, joins, constraints, etc. \n- Having the maturity/confidence to quickly learn on your own how to hack your way in some new programming language. \n\nI have 15 years industry experience with databases (not big data), scripting languages in Linux, and I had previously taken ML, ML4T, RL. The assignments took me like 20-30 hours each (spread through 2 weeks, a workload of 15 hours/week). \n\nOn the other hand I can see how for someone with no experience AT ALL in the skills mentioned above, this class could take as much as 30-40 hours/week. \n\nSome people have mentioned \"you HAVE to LEARN Pig/Hbase/Hive\". I don't think that's exactly the case. I found myself googling things like \"how to left join pig\" and adapting some snippet from S. O. On the other hand if you don't really know what an outer join, group by, etc. are, of course it will be hard to look for something you don't understand. \n\nCompleting the labs before the class started helped me a lot: http://www. sunlab. org/teaching/cse6250/spring2017/lab \nIn that way, I didn't waste time setting up the environment for each assignment (the labs are closely related with assignments 2, 3, and 4). \n\nAs other reviews as mentioned, you are mostly on your own on the 2nd part of the class, but I think the grading was very lenient.

You can do the project individually if you'd like (most people did, but I wanted a bigger project). It is also worth noting that you have one TA in this course - your mentor. So if you have any questions or want to know what to do to succeed, you have one person you can ask.

The homeworks were typically turned in online and we would get instant feedback. That was awesome.",

My undergrad included an AI specialization so I already had a decent understanding and moderate experience with machine learning. This class provided a good introduction to machine learning while still making the projects challenging enough for someone in my position to appreciate. \n\nMy biggest complaint with this class has to do with the fact that I took it over the summer. I would highly recommend that you take this class during a full-length semester if possible. I wanted to spend more time appreciating the concepts I was learning/implementing... but because of the fast pace of the summer, was unable to do so. I also didn't really appreciate that the instructors decided to add an extra exam this semester for the first time. It made the summer even more stressful than it already was. \n\nThe class is divided into 3 parts: 1) ML, 2) the stock market, 3) combining ML and the stock market. There are several projects (all coding, some include reports), two exams (finally is not cumulative), lots of lectures (with quizzes), and a participation grade that usually came in the form of a survey sent to your email. \n\nYou'll need extensive knowledge of Python for this class.",

There was a lot of \"here's the manual, here's a paper, learn this new technology, complete the project. \" Some of the project write-ups were downright terrible and did not include nearly enough information for someone inexperienced with that particular system to complete it on their own, certainly not within the given time frame. Thank goodness for Piazza. Wouldn't have been able to finish the class without it. \n\nAnother thing which really bugged me: each project had a separate VM, and NONE of them were ready to go out of the box. Each required re-configuring, setup, or installations which were time consuming and error prone. On more than one project I spent more time setting up the environment than I did completing actual work. \n\nFinal thoughts: don't take this in the summer, and brush up on Linux, Virtual Box, port scanning, Snort, and JavaScript first. Go in with the expectation that this is a self-taught course, and expect to spend a LOT of time on Piazza.

Read the official study guides and previous exams. Ignore the student generated stuff. That worked for me. \n\nThe course left me with an appetite for more ML, so that's what I'll take next. Entirely unexpected, but speaks to the quality here.",

This took the overwhelming majority of guesswork out of the course, and instead tested the ability to implement, which I consider a good move. \n\nThe final project actually didn't grade on actual stock algorithm performance, which would have been extremely difficult (everyone is trying to beat the market, and thus very few can). Identifying unique stock signals is an important part of trading, and I didn't have the time (nor millions of dollars) to conduct satellite surveillance of AAPL's parking lot to gauge what the share price should be (this is actually done in real life).

The optional textbook helps with that for this course. \n\nRequired for the summer were problem sets on Udacity (30%), project 1 (20%), project 2 (20%), final project (30%). There were numerous extra credit opportunities, both actual EC and pseudo EC that would push you to a higher grade if you were on the boundary. \n\nUdacity has all the answers for the problem sets and it was expected that we would use them before submitting. That's 30% of our grade just given to us. \n\nProject 1 was the runaway robot project on Udacity. Although it appears at the end of the Udacity course, only the first 3 lessons were relevant. Part 5 of the project ended up being extra credit. The first 4 parts are doable with basic math and probability, but the point is to use what was learned in those first 3 lessons. \n\nProject 2 involved helping a robot find its way around a warehouse. Contrary to what others say, the 3 parts of this project directly correspond to lessons 4, 5, and 6. Part A was a breeze. Part B was not but some really awesome students shared their own test cases on Piazza. Instructors used some when grading. They helped me find serious flaws in my code and my project 2 grade was better because of it. Thank you, awesome students. Anyone who didn't use those test cases only has themselves to blame. Part C had so many kinks it ended up becoming EC. Part B was regraded when it was discovered some test cases didn't match the project specs. \n\nFinal project, hexbug location prediction, sounds irrelevant to the material covered in class. It's not. It's certainly doable with irrelevant items but many successful projects used techniques (or extensions) from class. Using extensions of techniques learned in class is reasonable for a grad-level course in a top-tier school. \n\nTAs were great and helpful. Pryby as well, more so than others here suggest.",

I thought this course was not hard even though it was offered in the summer for the first time. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are not difficult to comprehend. I found the readings easy to understand due to how the amazing job the writers did. I made an effort to read all suggested chapters after watching the lectures. This will definitely help you to succeed in both the assignments and the exam. \n\nAssignments: Start early studying the requirements for these. Identify which part of the material you will need to solve them. However, don't start coding right away, the instructors were still making some modifications after the release date. Always prioritize coding efficiently. All assignments can be completed with runtimes less than 30 seconds. This will help you perform tests and modify your code faster. If your code is taking longer than that go back and try to find where it can be improved. \n\nExams: There were a midterm and a final both take home exams. Make sure you are caught up with the material (or at least most of it) before taking them. The questions are not hard and instructors were always there to clarify any possible ambiguity. They were also lenient with some questions when several students had a different interpretation of the problem statements. NOTE: Submit your pdf with what you did to get to the answer. They will give you partial credit if you got the answer wrong but your thought process was correct. \n\nStaff: In my opinion, the TAs did great. In spite of being the first summer offer, they handled the challenge well and were able to solve most issues. There were some problems with the final grading but my impression is that they eventually got resolved. \n\nI managed to get a 96% before the curve.

The assignments do force you to learn new technologies and techniques, but I'm sure that I could have learned a lot more in a lot less time if there was guidance. \n\nI don't have a specific interest in data science, but in general I can't imagine myself liking any course where there's no meaningful instruction and instead we're given time-consuming (40+ hour) homeworks to hack away at using whatever resources we can find. The amount of work required for the amount I was learning was too great and in all likelihood none of this will ever be useful to me professionally so I cut my losses and dropped.

There is no major challenge to the projects themselves, as they aren't designed to test you on your ability to solve problems, just how well you follow process and complete documentation (which isn't a complaint, that's the point of the class!). Unfortunately, there wasn't much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don't have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it. \n\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\n 1. Be careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things *very* awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\n 2. Check your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are *not* very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this.

Unfortunately, its a poor reflection of the OMSCS program and hopefully the feedback on OMSCentral will be used to improve the course.\n\nThere is almost no interaction between the instructors/TA and students on Piazza -- it was the least amount of Piazza/Slack activity I've observed so far in this program. There's pretty much nothing due for the first 4 weeks, then there's an extremely simple project that is made difficult through lack of clarity. After that, there's nothing due for a few more weeks until the Midterm that contains less than 20 multiple choice questions and is worth 25% of your grade. There is no direction on what to study, because the assessments are meant test the student's broad understand. This has the side effect of questions that are vague and open for interpretation, allowing multiple technically correct answers to some questions based on the level of abstraction of your interpretation. The books are just a really general overview of the topic. This course takes only a few hours of work per week to complete in its current state, and when the appropriate amount of effort is put forth, it will give you a 50% chance at a B, and 50% chance at an A. \n\nThe instructor is likable and he does a good job with the lectures, so that is one benefit. The instructor is knowledgeable in his field, just as you'd expect from a GA Tech professor.\n\nThis review isnt in retaliation for a bad grade, or a personal attack on any of the instructors; I received an A, and the instructors were willing to help a student when contacted. My theory is that outside of the lectures, the course was developed and operated by TAs from the brick and mortar program who just don't have much stake in the online program. I'd love to see this course improved upon.",

This may be one of the better \"easy\" electives to take in the OMSCS program, but it's definitely not one of the best courses in the program. \n\nThe lectures are shallow, fast paced, incomplete, and often a waste of time. The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It's nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren't covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is. \n\nThe projects are annoying. Often times there's a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile. The projects themselves often require spending a ton of time learning about very specific things to \"hack together\" the end result the instructors are looking for. The projects and lectures don't work together in any way; the projects require lots of learning of topics that are never taught by the instructors. Several of the projects were also very specific and not really accurate to real world situations. \n\nThis class is a shotgun scattershot of topics with poor instruction. The professor isn't engaged at all. The projects aren't hard, just frustrating and annoyingly time consuming for trivial things. If you'd really like to understand netsec, take 6035 and read Hackers' Playbook, Web App Hackers' Handbook, and Hacking: Art of Exploitation. Don't pay tuition for this course.",

While there are mostly no formal proofs involved (although you will have to give informal proofs), there is still a ton of material and concepts. The math isn't terrible, and everything you forgot is re-hashed by Dr. Vigoda so you can get back up to speed (although for graphs you will want to do a refresher on your own; otherwise this isnt needed). \n\nTo prep: I suggest going to the course website https://8803ga. wordpress. com/ and watching at least the first 2/3 of the lectures (the professor links to the videos on this page). I'd particularly suggest, at a minimum, getting re-acquainted with asymptotic notation and the basics of graphs (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and basic graph terms are either lightly covered or not covered, depending, but you will need to know them),  \n\nThe class is do-able, but be willing to prep OR be willing to spend 40 hour weeks on the course. If you are already comfortable with asymptotic notation and graph theory, Dynamic Programming (DP) and NP-Complete (NP) will take you the most amount of time, so if you have a good handle on those going in it will make life far easier. I would suggest being able to at least hold a light conversation in all of these topics; with no exposure to these, 80-100 hours spent on them before the class will surely pay off. ",

However, it is not a simple regurgitation of the materials.

In fact, to succeed in the class I would say that you have to go out and find other homework from other courses and do those problems as well. \n\nThe project was a coding assignment which was interesting but not too challenging once you wrapped your head around it.

Half of the class consists of short assignments, quizzes, and three essays which all have a hard word limit of 800 words, so you can't really go into depth for any of them. I felt like I didn't learn much through writing them because of this--I just scratched the surface of the topics. The only assignments that I feel like I benefitted from were a series of FHIR activities where we had to work with Java and perform various tasks with a FHIR database. It was a good crash corse in actually using FHIR. You could probably learn more from this course if you spend more time and did all the optional readings, but you could learn just as much independently, using google to find articles and information. I got 100% on everything so far, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't. \n\nThe second half of the class is a group project. You form groups or 4-6 and then can choose projects from a list provided. You rank your choices in order of preference and then you get what you get. You *are* allowed to think up your own project, but it is discouraged. Our group got one of our last choices, and it wasn't one I was even interested in, which made it very difficult to dedicate a lot of time to it. The project also ended up being quite different than we originally thought. You work with external \"mentors\" from various places like medical institutions, the CDC, etc, on the project. Many of the mentors are busy and don't have as much time to dedicate to the project as your group may need, so it can be difficult to get feedback from them or schedule phone calls. The group project also requires weekly status reports and quite a few powerpoint presentations, which took time to put together. I felt like this time could have been better used actually working on the project. Your grade is basically determined by how you do on the project, which highly depends on which project you end up with.",

Very responsive and understanding, and he always seems to be trying to improve the class. The lectures were expertly done and mostly enjoyable, and the content is useful and interesting. \n\nHowever, for some reason I just did not enjoy the class overall. I believe the main reason was the assignments. I had to force myself to do almost every one because I always felt like the assignments did not improve my understanding of the topics from the lectures - they were just \"busy work\" to me. I gained a good understanding of the course material after watching the lectures but I found myself spending hours trying to brainstorm ideas to apply that material to the essay-style questions that make up the assignments. In other words, I spent more time trying to come up with interfaces to write about than time learning the material. My feelings towards this might stem from the fact that I am a coder at heart and there were not any assignments that leveraged that. \n\nIn summary, if you don't mind doing a lot of brainstorming about different interfaces and writing about redesigns for them, then this class is great. If you decide to skip out on this course, at least bookmark the lectures and watch them in your free time - they are definitely worth it.",

It was tough material for me to grasp, and I needed a better game plan than what I've done for other classes.\nAfter retaking it this spring, I wound up with an A. Here's how:\nSo this spring when I took the class, I went in knowing that I needed to work on this class every day. So for the first month or so, I did at least 1 dynamic programming problem a day. And not just the ones they recommend - I did all of the ones in the DPV text, all of the ones in the Kleinberg-Tardos text. I also watched Erik Demaine's lectures on dynamic programming. This is all in addition to the every day requirements of this class (the homework and lectures, etc). For dynamic programming - draw the damn table on your scratch paper. Every time...draw the table! When we got around to the NP Complete problems I did the same thing - at least one problem a day. The other topics were tough as well, but these 2 topics are the most crucial to passing this course.\nAnything he says in the lecture is a 'key idea' or 'key concept' is going to show up on a test. Even if you think, how could they possibly test that? Trust me, it'll be on the exam.\nAlso, watch the office hours.\nThere's a project (they choose a different project each semester), but it is not difficult and only worth 10% of the grade. The tests are the bulk of the grade (85%).",

The textbook used was \"Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach, 3rd edition\". The course covers almost the entire textbook. This is a great course that gives an overview of all AI/ML techniques. Even though it covers such a wide breadth of topics, the course does fair amount of justice to them. All the topics are covered in a depth that you can get a fairly good idea about the topics. The knowledge you will gain in this course will not be shallow as is usually feared from courses that have a very wide course. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, I found the course to be fairly difficult. That is also given the fact that I did not have prior AI/ML experience. The assignments make us code various AI/ML algos from scratch with helps in a deeper understanding. Assignments will take time if your situation is like I had. Assignments are in python and good understanding of numpy can help. \n\nExams are open book and pretty tough but fun nonetheless. \n\nTA interactions are great. In my time we had at least 2 great TAs who were always active on slack. You might find lectures a bit too shallow but textbook and additional readings make up for that. \n\nIMO this course is a must if you dont have a prior AI/ML experience and want to pursue ML specialization.",

The 2nd and 3rd projects are hard especially if you haven't had much programming experience. The lab report assignments can be very time consuming, since there's a lot of graphs to embed into google docs documents and explanations to give. The tests are moderatly difficult to hard, so make sure you study. The later readings really pile up, and can be fairly dense and dry. The lectures are great overall, but can be a little unclear in explanations. The professor has also been mostly absent during the course, and has only given us one or two office hour videos. Luckily, the best parts of the course have been the amazing student resources. The Brainscape flash cards, the test prep notes, and the great questions have really made the class a lot better. Our TA (Stacy Stokes) has done a really great job in posting weekly office hours answering questions to help explain projects.

I came into the program with no CS background, minimal programming background, and zero experience with C, so the first few weeks of the class I was working probably 30-40 hours/week on the project, but it was manageable as I had few other commitments at the time. \n\nIf you can get past the first project you're definitely over the hump, the other projects were a bit easier. The course is also fairly generously curved, I ended up getting an A when I thought I was solidly in the B range. Overall, I would highly recommend this course as it is well run by both the professor and the TAs, and you learn a lot.",

There are only 4 assignments so you have several weeks to do each, but each one covers broad regions of the ML landscape.

Guidelines are given regarding grading, but they don't tell you exactly what you need to do to get a high score. This frustrates some people, but I think it's reasonable because this is grad school, not undergrad, and we need to develop the ability to do independent research and determine on our own what is important, what questions to ask, how to get answers to those questions, etc. If we can't do those things we'll never be able to discover or invent something new. \n\nYou are free to write your code in whatever language you choose. Mostly you'll choose a library with the ML algorithms you need instead of writing everything from scratch (which would require a superhuman effort). Python and scikit-learn are popular as is Weka and other Java libraries. \n\nThis course isn't about becoming an expert in ML (that would be impossible in 1 semester).

At this moment, we have been waiting for answers for questions for the assignment due this week (November 8, 2017), and it is 3 days and we haven't received answers. But guess what! Yes, when it comes to grade the assignments do not expect the best results, these TA's are like in the Olympus, untouchable. They use this autograde system that will never grade as a human does. Even if you are not very good developing, their comments or feedback will push down, making you feel like you are not worthy of becoming a developer, or something else, because we have to be honest, this master program isn't to make 'software developers', it is for anybody in the area of computer science: IT engineers, developers, architects, etc. The name of this course sounds interesting, but the content to me is awful. I don't know the reason we have to be doing like more than 50% in software testing if there is already a course called 'Software Analysis and Testing'. \n\nBy the way, get ready to be part of an experiment, when it comes to use this tool called 'TSLGenerator'. There is no valuable information on the internet for this, nor videos, etc. Nothing! The little you can learn you get from the Udacity lectures. So, the only reason I am taking it is because it is one of the options as requirements. The other course is 'Computability, Algorithms, and Complexity', thus, either you take SDP or you take CAC. \n\nThe schedule for assignments due? The worst! They are due every Friday night; Saturday morning for some people. I wonder why they do that, when other courses assignments are due on Sundays. It looks like the people leading this course do not have a sense of humanity. They do not care if you have a family or if you are in another course: assignments are due every week on Friday!",

I particularly liked the ones on Android and White-Box Testing. I plan on using what we learned about Extended TSL for automating test cases at work. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Holy hell, the TAs are awful. I'm more than half-way done with my OMSCS degree, so this isn't my first rodeo - this has been without a doubt my worst course experience. The co-head TAs (Will and Erin) are defensive, easy to anger, slow to answer threads, and almost purposefully ambiguous in their replies to simple yes or no questions (e. g. \"is X a requirement?\" or \"Should the behavior be X or Y?\"). I'm a pretty agreeable person, but I feel like I need to get my blood pressure examined after each interaction with them on Piazza. \n\n- The assignment docs are poorly proof-read, contain errors, and are often ambiguous. \n\n- There is an assignment due every Friday night (or early Saturday depending on your time-zone). Assignments are released the previous Saturday morning. This wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were responsive - but posts routinely take 2-3 days to get a response. Usually the responses are ambiguous, defensive, and over-all unhelpful. All in all, this makes for a stressful weekly experience. SUGGESTION TO THE PROFESSOR: Please consider releasing assignments 1-2 days early (Thursday instead of Saturday). Or work with your TAs to get better response times. Or have the TAs do a better job at proof-reading the assignments beforehand. \n\n- Feedback is non-existent. It's November 10th, and we're still waiting for grades on assignments that were submitted back in September. The feedback we have gotten has been one or two poorly worded sentences. A silver lining is that the TAs grade easy; but I'm here to learn and feedback is crucial to that process. Other OMSCS classes do a really good job at feedback, so it's definitely possible with a class this size.",

You might think an entire course about regression analysis would be a bit light, particularly if you're already experienced in machine learning; you're fitting a line, right?  Haha, no.  When you're done with this class (or it's done with you), you WILL understand regression - and in particular how to evaluate regression models, choose among models and figure out how reliable their estimates (or predictions) are.\n\nDownsides: the wording of exam and homework questions is sometimes a little off, and it requires a certain amount of teasing out what they really meant to ask.  (The instructor is reasonable about these, though, and if the wording is outright incorrect she will make sure points aren't deducted.)  It's easier at the end of the course than at the beginning.",

This means you are not afraid of hard work or challenging problems.  The course material is intriguing and immensely practical.  The lessons learned in the process will vary, but you will improve beyond the lessons taught in the classroom.  You could not get more relevant and interesting projects.

I registered this course after reading the on campus syllabus (My bad), when I saw the OMS syllabus, it was too late to withdraw and waitlist another course, so I decide to take it. The on campus version included all modern technologies SQL, Tableau, D3, Hadoop, Azure, Hbase, Pagerank etc.. But the OMS version is basically week 1-6: intro to R and ggplot in R; week 7 till end: regressions in R. The syllabus speaks for itself, a more appropriate name should be \"intro to regression with R\" or \"the linear regression half of stat 101\". These knowledge might be useful 10 years ago when everything was analyzed in memory, but now... I'm almost to the end of this semester, I've completed most of the homework/project in slow Friday afternoons at work without watching the videos. I have a statistical background, but to be honest, the course (homework) covered nothing more than linear regression, I assume most of us coming to the program should have some knowledge of linear regression. \n\n The only scenarios I think you should take this class:\n 1. you need a low involvement course: eg. you are paring it with an intensive 30+ hour course.  \n 2. (more important) if you are in the Machine Learning specialization, you have to chose 3 electives from the 4 courses offered. If you have one course you don't want (eg. BD4H), you'll have to take all the rest of the 3. ",

The front half of the class and project 1 had a higher time commitment (12 hours / week) for me compared to the second half (4-6 hours / week). The videos are good, but not the best ones I've seen in the OMS CS program.  The videos didn't always illustrate complex things such as DES, AES, RSA, and TLS hand-shake clearly, but supplementing with other sources and the book cleared that up.  I used the international edition of the book which is less expensive, but sacrifices the on-line material and some additional chapters which would have been helpful in a couple cases.  The first assignment in C was more challenging for me, but the other assignments were fairly easy and straight forward.  We used C, Python, and JavaScript, but you don't have to have a significant amount of programming experience in those; you can Google your way through most of it.

I also liked the fact that the professor provided supplementary videos that guided the students on how to tackle projects.  A big portion of this course is getting familiar with numpy and pandas.  Another big portion of the course is getting insight on hedge funds, and other types of funds, and how they try to use mathematical equations and fundamental and technical analysis to find ways to beat the market.  A final portion of the class is learning about basic ML algorithms such as Q-learners and Random forests, and gaining insight on how they can be used to make trading decisions.  For many of the projects you have to write reports that are worth a significant portion of the project grade, and you can even get 1 or 2 extra credit points on a report if you put in the time to thoroughly analyze your results.  I enjoyed how the online students were lumped together with the on campus students.  My biggest complaint is there are a lot of details in the instructions that are easy to miss but can impact your grade on a project quite a bit, so always read the directions carefully.  For example, you could lose 10-20 points for forgetting to put your name.  Staying active on slack is very helpful, because people will often point out important points in the directions that you might miss.\n\nUnfortunately, you will most likely not learn enough from this class alone to apply machine learning strategies in real life situations, but the class will give you a strong foundation if you are interested in exploring that field.

After the first month or so it the content did branch away from Info Sec. This class is structured very similarly to Info Sec. Mainly project based. Final exam. Quizzes. I found the projects to be pretty easy (usually finished them in a day) but very insightful. I enjoyed learning from the projects. The lectures were harder to learn from. Just like Info Sec the professor tries to teach too much in every video - makes it hard to focus. Plus, I never found a connection between the videos and the projects. The quizzes and videos quickly begin to feel like busy work. I think this class would be better if it had one more project and dropped either the final exam or the quizzes. During the semester I took the class we had a month for the last project. So this would be a good class to pair with another class that has a lot of work towards the end of the semester. I also wish the TAs would have graded things with a little more care. I had to submit regrade requests for every project. Also, the project's instructions were really hard to follow sometimes.\n\nOverall, a good class if you are new to security. Probably easier if you take Info Sec first. ",

I rated it medium because really most of the projects took me around 6 hours to complete. Which I really don't think is bad. There were really only two projects that took around 8-10 hours to complete so in the end I rated it medium because most of the projects were. On average with assignments and lectures (plus the occasional reading), I would say it took me around 12 hours a week. That's on the high side again given that homework is due usually every other week. That being said here's the review. The course is really split into two sections. The front half is a lot of stock and market information with hands on Python assignments to supplement the learning. The latter half of the course is more machine learning in conjunction with Python and stock and finances. You don't need to be an experience python user to take this course. Though I did have experience using the Python libraries and Python is a language I program in every day so it will certainly help. Also, you don't have to be a stock expert. The lectures are straightforward an well laid out in nice manageable chunks. In fact most were 1 hour lectures I could easily do during my lunch if I wanted. The profession is very knowledgeable, funny, and a good presenter; you'll enjoy watching the lectures. This class really glances over a few machine learning algorithms and you'll program a few but I wouldn't say it's a full deep dive into Machine Learning. In fact it's really about using algorithms to trade stocks and manage portfolios. This of course makes it solid intro class. There were of course some drawbacks. Communications throughout the semester was terrible. Reddit was used instead of Piazza for this semester which I think threw a lot of non-reddit users through a loop. I happen to use it often but it made the threads really noisy and messy with people asking numerous redundant questions and not putting comments in the right threads. Additionally, communication from the professor was far and few between. Assignment \"updates\" or comments about questions in the reddit threads (which could easily grow in the few thousands) were fair game for requirements on assignments (even if not listed on the rubric). Assignments were hardly finalized until a 3-5 days before their due date and portals to submit were often times opened days before they were actually due. My TA was impossible to get ahold of throughout the semester. The assignments tended to have subtle but time consuming changes that needed to happen each week (one week give the output in this dataframe and the next is needs to be a series or another datatype). This wouldn't be bad overall if two things happened. 1. There was a blip or sample of what the output should look like. 2. Each week you weren't forced to retool your other classes and functions to accommodate the returns to be some new data type for the input of a new function. Overall, the factors above speak for themselves. I found the course engaging and entertaining enough to give it a Liked, I didn't spend forever on it each week, and it was fairly average difficulty wise.",

I've compared it with students who took it on-campus a couple years ago and there's a staggering difference.\n2 closed book exams, rather than 1 open-note midterm.\nOptional \"difficult\" extra credit assignments have become full fledged assignments.\n\nThe class is great overall. My favorite aspect was the implementation of learning algorithms. I took RL and ML beforehand, but they were more theory based or had you use libraries. I felt like this refined some of my ML knowledge. I didn't know much about finance or the stock market coming in, so I appreciated taking that away from the class as well.\n\nGetting a good grade is another story. There is no curve, and I could see it being easy to mess up one assignment and totally kill any hope of you getting an A or B. Thus in order to succeed, you have to come at it in full-force. Don't underestimate some of the assignments. Start early or learn regret the hard way.\n\nThe workload is medium. Probably just the right amount of class-work for someone employed full-time. Sometimes I would have to devote all of Saturday or my entire weekend to the class.\n\nThe professor has nice lectures, but the reddit format was painful despite being a \"redditor\". Join a discussion late, and your comments will go buried. I agree with the other poster who mentioned that the class isn't the most flexible around the online student's time.

I found the exam still only took me 2-3 hours to complete. The final was also 24 hours in 7 days, so they will likely keep that format going forward. \n\nAssignments and exams are in Jupyter notebooks that walk you though the exercises. Lectures correspond to most of the notebooks, but if you're a quick learner you can get almost all the material just from the notebook. Instead of writing the entire large program, the notebook includes some code written by the instructors and you write code to fill in the blanks.\n\nOverall, I found it pretty easy, and it paired well with ISYE 6501 (Intro Analytics).

Peer grading could be a struggle since the grading standards are fairly open-ended. The exams are multiple choice and matching, but are actually quite tricky. None of the concepts are overly difficult to comprehend, but the question phrasing and deeper connections make the exams more challenging than you would expect. Weekly homework (due a week later), plus a course project (given a month to complete) and three equally-weighted exams spaced throughout the semester.",

If you have any experience programming, you'll immediately notice corollaries to whatever language you are familiar with.  The TA Office Hours are very useful for learning how to use R if you're struggling.  The homework assignments help you understand how to use the concepts from the lectures in an applied way.  The course project is essentially a slightly longer homework assignment, on a topic of your own choosing.  It follows a basic case study format.  The exams are multiple choice and drag & drop.  They're tricky, but not overly difficult.  Anything covered in the lectures is fair game -- even concepts that are only touched upon briefly.",

It's rather general but with no security knowledge coming in that was fine by mean. The lectures are easy to watch and you do get the general ideas you need from them. The book is SUPER dry but needed. Not necessarily to read all the way through but to skim for sure. Certain sections won't be touched in the videos. Lots of googling and piazza will help you through the projects. They're not hard you just don't always have the specifics you need to complete them. Shout out to TA Scott for helping me through two of them when there was a bug in the VM / wasn't given enough info to start with. Quizzes are crazy easy but the exam are definitely harder. Not sure hard but not as easy as everything else. You can't always anticipate the questions and they can be really vague. You should be able to fine in the class regardless of the exams, though.

            "text": "Not a good class.\n\nMaterial: The first half of the class teaches you some outdated APIs with little to no documentations, which feel like some orphaned research project. I fail to see how they can be any use once you move outside of academia. Second half teaches you tools that may actually be useful, but less than 50% good does not make up for the horrid 50%.\nAssignments: Extremely frustrating. Some assignments are extremely easy while the some are very difficult, not because you learn some difficult yet interesting concept, but because they are designed to be - otherwise all the assignments will take only a few hours to complete. Most assignments are auto-graded, so if you have typos in your typed answer don't expect any leniency. There's no Slack chat for the class - again if one existed the assignments would have been super easy. Some can be completed by \"throwing random inputs at the wall and see what sticks\", which is actually a valid testing framework, according to some lecture.\nLectures: Difficult concepts are skimped, while lecturer spends a lot of time explaining obvious, common-sense concepts. Lectures are mostly disconnected with assignments. Expect maybe 10 minutes of useful materials and 30 minutes of filler contents, and unlike ESPN the filler contents can give you a coma. Examples are not adequate so the office hours are mandatory if you want to understand what's going on, which you really don't since....\nExams: Completely different from the samples and the lectures. I mean, seriously, if I didn't study Statistics in college (yes, statistics) I would have easily lost 25% on the exams. Esoteric concepts from lectures were drilled, so you have to really think outside of the box. It's excellent to get students to drop the class and apparently so, since piazza traffics pretty went quiet the weeks after the midterm.\nTAs and Professor: The Professor did not show up at all so we can safely disregard him. TAs work really hard answering questions and maintaining conversation but harder not revealing solutions. I feel sorry for them, since their hands are tied. The way assignments are simply prevent them from having a meaningful conversation about the concepts. Sometimes by explaining things in a non-revealing way they ended up confusing people. \n\nSave your time and $800+ and take another class. ",

            "text": "Overall a very good class for general computer science program.\nPrerequisites: Python (basic), C (basic), controls theory (undergraduate level). \n\nI definitely recommend taking the course, especially as one of the earlier courses in your plan of study. The reason being that the content, assignments and projects introduces a lot of different fields - network sockets, controls (primarily open vs closed loop with single and multi-variable feedback), system modeling, embedded programming and architecture design & analysis among other CPS topics. The course can be coupled with SDP course and I think the two together shall provide a strong fundamental mechanisms required for other OMSCS courses. \n\nI found the Udacity lectures to be very good but with lot of information. It is a good thing! I took lot of hand-written notes as I went through the lectures and that was helpful to enforce the concepts/theory/case studies. The assignments were primarily hands-on, i.e. programming in C or Python. Starter codes were provided for all assignments/projects and the tasks themselves don't require a lot of programming but it requires understanding of how the starter code works. Understanding involves ability to read the provided code and also run experiments with the code. This might require exploring some external resources especially in C or Python in case you have minimal experience. The instructors are very helpful and held a weekly Q&A session (Saturday), though not many students participated to take advantage of the instructors availability. Beyond that any additional information required for the tasks has to be researched just like in any graduate course.\n\nThe course towards the end introduces AADL (a model based language) for a project but the time frame to learn AADL was short and coupled with the project deliverable which made the project more challenging. But challenges are fun, right? I found this to be one of the best part of the course. It would have been nice if at least the last two projects were based on AADL as that would give ample time to learn the language and related simulation tool and also be able to focus on the required project tasks properly.\n\nIf you are interested to know about - systems at large, embedded systems, real-time systems and controls, robotics, quadcopters (lot of examples based on this) and architecture development, then take this course. It is a good introduction from both computer science and CPS perspective.",

            "text": "DISCLAIMERS:\nThis was my first course in the program, so I spent a fair amount of time early in the semester learning basic OMSCS infrastructure (Udacity, Piazza, T-Square, slack). Related, although I have experience as a software engineer, my current job is entirely different. So I also spent a good chuck of time creating a workable setup on my machine (Cygwin, .bashrc aliases, git). Finally, although Java is clearly stated as a prerequisite, my closest experience is C++ from 15 years ago. So coming up to speed there was nontrivial.\n\nPROS:\nProfessor Orso is a ton of fun! The lectures are great and the office hours are helpful. I enjoyed the material and appreciated the weekly assignment cadence. This course has been refined over many iterations, and the instructors are very clear that the decision to make each assignment due on Saturday morning is a deliberate one. Initially I was unhappy about this, but came to rather enjoy it by using some weekend time to get ahead on the homework rather than scrambling to meet the deadline. We were exposed to several technologies and tools (git, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Java, JUnit, markdown, XML). The Android Studio group project was a lot of fun. Groups were assigned based on mutually available meeting times and complementary Java experience, which worked out great! \n\nCONS:\nAssignment grades were consistently very late. I literally had no idea how I was doing in the course for the first half of the semester. (As a new student, this was particularly unsettling!) The instructors take grading very seriously, and go to lengths to ensure fairness by making sure grade distribution from TA to TA isn't skewed, releasing all grades simultaneously, and so on. I do prefer a fair grade over a fast grade, so I appreciated this. However, I think it's also reasonable to expect timely qualitative feedback, perhaps with a delayed quantitative grade. (Otherwise, there's no difference between OMSCS and watching Lynda videos!) I felt the lack of timely feedback hampered my learning and caused unnecessary anxiety.",

There is a Alt project after the first mandatory RPM project that deals with chat bot which I believe is more relevant than RPMs. Expect lots of writing in this class. I struggled with the writing assignments in the beginning but managed through later as I adjusted to the rhythm. In all there are 3 writing assignments, 3 projects with the project reflection associated with them, a mid term and a final exam. If you hate writing, this class may not be for you. Projects can use Python or Java. I would recommend brushing up your Python skills, especially Pillow and numpy for RPMs and NLTK for chat bot.

            "text": "Background knowledge:  Do not be fooled by the supposed required background knowledge.  They said we needed to be \"familiar\" with \"a high level programming language like Java or C++).  For your own health and safety, do not attempt this class without a very solid foundation in BOTH Java and C++, and experience in C and Bash scripting would definitely help to have in advance.  I went in not knowing C++ and we ended up having an assignment written in that language with a special framework that I got a 30 on because I had to spend so much time just trying to figure out the language and the corresponding special framework that I barely got around to actually figuring out the concept behind the assignment.  Don't make my mistakes.\n\nClass material:  There were definitely some interesting and useful concepts sprinkled in, but I work in this field and had never heard of most of the concepts/testing techniques in this class.  Either my company is just really terrible at testing, or a lot of these techniques are outdated, far too specific, or not used in the actual business world, and I think it's the latter.  There was some material that was very useful, but many of the lectures were incredibly boring and slow-moving.  Lots of time was spent on background and not as much on the actual concepts.\n\nAssignments:  This is what killed the class for me.  Assignments were either ridiculously easy (an hour or two) or impossibly difficult (30+ hours, and the majority were like this).  There were 7 total and I came to dread each release of a new assignment.  For me, they felt like an enormous leap from the lectures and I felt completely lost for the first third of the time spent on the tough ones.  Provided resources were extremely limited and lacked detail, and the concepts nearly always couldn't be found anywhere on the web, so I had to rely on asking the other students and TAs on Piazza for everything I couldn't understand, which was frustrating.  Overall the assignments tested our ability to figure out what we are supposed to do with the tiniest scraps of information as possible rather than our understanding of the concepts from class, so they felt like a huge and infuriating waste of time.\n\nExams:  The midterm was tough but I felt it was pretty fair.  We were given a practice exam for both the midterm and final and I felt the practice gave a good feel for what the real exam is like.  The class average was a 65 on the midterm, but the grades were curved soon afterwards.  The exams are open-lecture notes.  \n\nProfessors/TAs:  One of our professors was very dedicated, consistent with office hours, and was always on Piazza helping out and answering questions.  The other professor who recorded the lectures showed up for one office hours, which were supposed to be weekly, and then cancelled each week after that before finally not scheduling them at all and being replaced by rotating TAs.  The TAs were helpful and seemed dedicated to helping the students, and they seem like they had to carry a lot of the weight, so I commend them for that.\n\nThis was my first class in the entire program and it had me questioning whether the program was right for me.  I am hoping I will have a better experience in other classes.  Overall, I can't necessarily recommend the class but if you are better prepared (see section 1 of my review) you will probably suffer much less than I did.",

There were 5 projects, a midterm, and a final. The lectures felt very fast-paced and covered a broad subject at a shallow level, so it was hard to actually learn much from them. I agree with another student that the projects were somewhat disconnected from the lectures. Some of the projects even felt like they really belonged in Info Sec - as if the professor didn't accomplish everything he wanted to in that class, so he's using Network Security as a place to put the overflow. The professor's involvement in the class was minimal - I was active a few times in Slack, and often on Piazza, but I never saw any activity from Prof. Lee in either place, which is disappointing. The class was instead run (somewhat haphazardly) by TAs. The quizzes were poorly or ambiguously worded, sometimes such that there was more than one technically correct answer. Project writeups were often filled with errors or inconsistencies, which had to be resolved on Piazza, and unfortunately made the projects a bit harder to tackle since it was hard to distinguish parts you didn't understand from parts that were just wrong. Project skeleton code had typos that made one wonder if the TAs had actually tried to run the code before publishing it. The autograders were also poorly written, and many students (myself included) had to request regrades for one or more projects due to autograder issues.  Overall, could be a good class with interesting material, but feels poorly executed.",

Grading makes this class relatively simple since most of the grade is based on the projects, but the tests are vary hard. The tests seem to cover topics that are either barely covered in the videos, or combinations of topics that we are expected to figure out on our own. ",

            "text": "The content of this course is really interesting, though it feels to me like too much for one course - 30 hours of dense lecture videos exceed any class I've taken so far. The six projects had two week windows (plus a 3 week final project) and typically required tremendous effort, an average of 40 to 50 hours, and a peak of 70 hours for me. They mostly started off pretty cool - the coding was fun, the outputs were impressive - but typically had was too many parts, such that by the end the joy was sucked out of them. PS2 about sign detection was particularly atrocious in this regard. It just had way too much packed in. A notable exception was PS3 on augmented reality, which had a more reasonable workload (~30 hours), which allowed it to be strictly fun. It's my understanding that they redid a bunch of the projects this semester and it sounds like they got harder. This also meant there were frequent bugs in provided code, though I'd imagine this will be less of an issue going forward if they keep the same projects. In my opinion this course would be better off either split into two courses or with a little less depth; I was just so fatigued by the end that I really didn't enjoy it, even though the content is fascinating.\n\nI am surprised by the recent review which commends the instructional staff - this course has objectively the worst instructor interaction of any of six courses I've taken thus far. For example, there are a combined 320 unanswered questions or unresolved followups on Piazza, roughly 10x the next worst class I've taken by this metric. The ratio of instructor responses to student responses is 0.642 - I've rarely (never?) had a class below 1.0. There were commonly bugs in project code that would be caught by students, and the instructors would not post updates or even make conspicuous announcements about the errors to save hours of pointless frustration for students on already tremendous projects. The one glaring exception to this trend were TA Matt Houston's office hours, which were excellent. The actual instructor, Dr. Essa, was completely absent - no office hours, no Piazza, etc. In fact, one of just two times he ever showed up on Piazza was to attack some students who implied that he was absent!\n\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "This class is in need of a top-to-bottom overhaul. Let's start from the top: a class called \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\" should, at some point, mention \"Analytics\" somewhere. They didn't even try to connect it with the subject that 100% of its students came to study.\n\nInstead, this is a hodge-podge of (way, way too many) business concepts crammed together, taught with no connection to one another in four batches by four professors. The first lecturer, teaching business accounting, was absolutely atrocious. He clearly was just winging his way through his lectures, rambling with maybe a loose outline in front of him. Editing the transcripts into some semblance of a coherent study tool, it was possible to edit out 40-70% of the text without any loss of information, so redundant and bloated was the text. The second lecturer was marginally better, but his handwriting in the few problems we were given as examples was atrocious, and he would throw out acronyms without explanation.\n\nThere were far too few checks for understanding and practice problems, and then the homework and exams were brutally unforgiving. Accounting problems that would take 10-20 minutes to complete would have single, graded all-or-nothing multiple-choice submissions (and sometimes, fill-in-the-blank, better-get-it-exactly-right-the-first-time fields). All of the other choices were gotchas based on common errors you may have made because the inadequate teaching you received hadn't prepared you to do it exactly right. \n\nAnd then abruptly midway through the course, the graded homework stopped, replaced by a torrent of lectures -- nearly 100 more videos crammed full of micro-topics with no indication as to what was important, what would be tested on, what was intended to ground larger important concepts. The practice problems were absolutely all over the place, making it totally unclear as to what we could expect on the final. \n\nStaff didn't seem to care about student's concerns when these were voiced. Flury's most common response to students worried about their grade was that the grades overall were adequate. When students said concepts weren't clear, the typical response was essentially that, yes, they were. Oh, sorry, our bad, I guess.\n\nThis was my fourth online class through Georgia Tech and by far the worst. I thoroughly enjoyed the other three, and look forward to the rest of the program. Had MGT 6754 been the first I took, I would not have returned. The contrast is about what I would expect from a school with a top-ten-rated analytics program and a business school described by the Financial Times as \"third-tier.\" ",

I had to do all sorts of outside research, but I think that is expected.  The T.A's did a great job, shoutout to all of them (especially Chris Serrano for his slack help during P2) they were very supportive and active on piazza and slack.\n\nI have a background in ML so that was helpful (especially for P2, where you need to basically use DL).  The videos are mostly good, but I highly recommend people to watch David Silver series.  It seriously helps for the first 4 HW's and 2 projects.  I would actually watch him first, then Charles and Michael.  They are very deep and abstract, while he is really concrete and practical.  I think it's better to have the \"normal\" stuff first before you get blasted into space and time.\n\nMy main issue was with the lectures actually, it's just very theoretical material and I could not always follow.  Watching at 1.3x speed is a good idea to get broad strokes, especially if you don't love proofs.\n\nThe final is pretty hard -  make sure to study for it.\n\nFinally, I did well on the projects, but I somehow unlocked what the T.A's did not spell out. Which is that you need to write your report about what the project means, not what you did. Which may not be obvious, because doing the actual work involved a lot of head-banging and late nights, so by the time you are done with the work you may forget to think about why you did it at all.\n\n\n",

There were so many times I wanted to quit because it was so difficult, but I persevered and I am pretty sure I did well enough on the final to pass.  The homeworks seem almost impossible at times.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  If you can't do some of the problems just do the best you can (they are only worth 5% of the overall grade) and wait for the solutions to be released and then go back and learn how to do the problems.  The exam questions are similar to the homeworks and actually seem a little easier than the homework problems.  Professor Vigoda says he wants the HW to challenge you.  So, if you can understand how to do them, you should be pretty well prepared for the exams.  To prepare for this class, you can go to the course website to see the topics and watch some youtube videos on them.  The MIT OCW videos were also helpful at times for a different perspective.  Dr. Vigoda places a strong emphasis on Dynamic Programming.  He once stated on the forums, if you don't know DP you won't pass this class.  DP boggled my mind when I first encountered the topic.  However, I leave the class relatively confident that I could apply it one day if necessary.  The lecture videos are excellent, he repeats the information enough that it sinks in better than some courses where they just state the facts and immediately move on.  I can't believe I'm saying this after how difficult it was... but after it was all over I actually liked it.  If it was easy, it wouldn't have the same meaning or impart the same feeling of accomplishment and that's why we're at GaTech, right?",

The course does not dive deep into the implementation aspect of machine learning algorithms. So set your expectation straight! The two professors are really entertaining, they did a great job in adding colors to the materials which are dry in nature. I love most of the lectures except the one on Markov Decision Process. To me, it would be more intuitive to walk through an example of value iteration before throwing tons of equations at the audience. The course did exactly the opposite which gave me a hard time. Outside the lectures, the course itself is depressing. There are four assignments in the course. They are asking serious a lot for each. I would expect to spend 100 hours for each assignment to get to the place where they expect you to be. Unfortunately it is not realistic since i am juggling between job, family and study as most of us here. The grading criteria should be better communicated, my overall impression is that the grading lacks consistency. TAs give grade based on their personal tastes.  The feedback should be more constructive and to motivate students to explore more. To me, the feedback is only a list of missing tests which are only implied in the assignment specification. I was discouraged each time after reading the TA's feedback. Overall, this is a reasonably well organized course. The materials are quite dry and TAs are expecting a lot from your assignment without telling exactly what they want you to do.",

The udacity assignments (problem sets + mini robot) should be 100% and that covers about 40% of grade.  Be very careful about falling behind on project 2 as you'll want to have a good implementation of it as project 3 is a very difficult extension of it.  I think all told I spent close to 100+ hours on projects 2/3 together.  I would highly recommend a TDD approach for these later projects because they can get pretty complicated and finding bugs once the system is fully built can be very difficult.  Most of the assignments and early projects culminate in the later ones so if you fall behind or have a bad project early plan to spend extra time on the later assignments.",

There is homework almost every week.  It's well designed and if you actually try to learn you'll learn quite a bit.  I encourage people to use the TA office hours as confirmation of approach after you have tried to solve the homework on your own.  You'll learn far less if you just watch the TA office hours and copy their code.  Exams are hard but fair.  Dr Sokol does a good job of making you think.

I have my undergrad in business, but I am always hesitant to skip courses as I feel that you can always learn something.  In the end, I learned very little in this class.  There are two major issues with this class, one the professors have no clue how to teach an online course in this format and two, the content of the class is too generic.  The clearest example of that is their videos.  The videos are basically just one hour lectures broken up into smaller segments.  The videos are too long and inefficient and some of them (strategy and marketing) end up sounding as if the professor is just reading out of a text book.  The videos are generally long and rambling.  It makes them hard to rewatch if you need to brush up on concepts.  There is very little in the way of graded assignments and no homework assignments that cover marketing or strategy.  When I finished the second finance homework (the last homework of the semester) is was Halloween and I didn't touch this class again for almost a month.   The exams are fine.  The no partial credit thing is brutal on the exams.  So many of the questions are of the \"Pick all that apply\" type and to miss one and get zero credit is dumb.  There are high point value finance questions that are quite involved where one small error could torpedo your answer and materially impact your grade.  On the final 28 of the last 108 points of the exam were tied up in four fairly involved financial calculations that you are doing with an on screen calculator (set aside the fact that only an idiot would not do this in excel or without a financial calculator).  \n\nThe content of this class also needs a rework.  This class is so generic that you could require it in ANY non business graduate program and the class would not need to be changed in any way.  Analytics is NEVER mentioned.  Even when you're in the marketing module where it is obvious that a detailed discussion of analytics could add value, it doesn't happen. The content goes way too far into the weeds.  I am studying to be an analytics professional not get an MBA.  Far too much time in finance and accounting was spent on how to low level detail calculations for things like NPV, weighted average cost of capital and activity based costing .  I can see needing to know what these are and how they are used, but I will never be asked to take this down to this level.  \n\nThe content of the course just reeks of laziness honestly. Either the business school doesn't understand how to do online education or they don't care.  ",

You work on a number of quick assignments, as well as 3 essays, but the bulk of the course is spent on a group project. Lectures are good but light on content, you're finished with them halfway through the course. The group project is teams made up of 4-6 people working on mostly pre-defined projects in the healthcare field. In most projects you work with a mentor who is in the healthcare field. As long as you're with a competent team the group project should be fairly manageable. This course would pair nicely with another course as its workload is light and you can balance around a lot of the work to fit your schedule.    ",

In my opinion, The videos are definitely the best in the OMSCS. The material is dense but Dr Bobick cuts through the math and makes it digestible. He has a great sense of humor, and even his interaction with Megan (the videographer) cracked me up several times. Even the seemingly small detail of having a black background was well thought out, and make the videos not too straining to the eye. The problem sets are hard and you need to get on them as soon as possible. Beware of the first major assignment (Road sign detection) because it is deceivingly difficult, and the video tracking assignment which was super difficult as well. The final project will easily take up the time of 3 assignments put together. Matthew Houston definitely deserves high praise for his high-quality recorded office hours. To conclude, It's a lot of work, but you'll be glad you did it.\n\nAs an aside, I was looking at the table of contents of the CV books on Amazon, and was amazed that the class covered MORE THAN ENTIRE BOOKS on the subject!",

            "text": "Incredible class. The material is extremely interesting, and the assignments/project weren't overly difficult and really emphasized lecture material (although they were VERY time consuming). This was my first class in the program, but this course is probably one of the best courses I've ever taken! Including all of my graduate-level classes as well! Very rewarding, but very time-consuming.\n\nThere is a huge amount of material covered. It helps that Dr.Bobick's videos are not only incredibly well laid out and clear, but also quite enjoyable to watch. They're also very thorough, so as long as you can fit enough time to dedicate to lectures (4-6 hours a week) you'll learn quite a bit within each topic. Assignments matched the lecture material fairly well, and were for the most part well-defined and weren't too confusing.\n\nAssignment breakdown with estimated difficulty / time consumption for those that like this sort of thing:\nAssignment 1 -- easy; ~4-8 hours\nAssignment 2 -- hard; 40-60 hours\nAssignment 3 -- mid; ~25-40 hours\nAssignment 4 -- mid; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 5 -- mid/hard; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 6 -- mid; ~20-30 hours\n\nWe had 2 weeks to complete each assignment, and they were always back-to-back so there was really no break in between. Previous offerings of the class seem to have had additional assignments, but starting this term we had a final project instead of the last (2?) assignment(s). The final project had a few selection options, to further explore more advanced and state-of-the-art algorithms for methods we used in assignments and/or other material presented in class that we didn't work on in assignments, and we were given 3 weeks to complete it. Many people thought there were too many things required to be completed for the projects, particularly the convolutional neural network project, so it could easily take 70+ hours to complete everything. A lot of the time spent on assignments and even on the final project is parameter tweaking. Be prepared to have fairly well designed algorithms in place, but spend loads of time tweaking parameter values to achieve optimal results.\n\nThe final exam was open-book and the study guide was very representative of what you needed to know for it. It was a fair exam. As long as you can review most, if not all, of the material beforehand, and find answers to all of the practice questions in the study guide, the exam is not difficult at all. Questions tended to be pretty base-level, focusing mainly on overall concepts and important algorithm details discussed in class. \n\nTAs were for the most part responsive, but as others have noted, Matthew Houston's office hours were a huge asset in completing the assignments. The forums were very helpful for finding out where to go when you were stuck and/or for discussing the assignments.\n\nI highly recommend this class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. It would help to review some linear algebra, and numpy if you aren't comfortable with using it yet. If you have some time, you could try and familiarize yourself with openCV 2.4 as well, as you'll be using this package a lot in the class. Don't wait until the last minute to start assignments, start on them early so it doesn't bite you when the deadlines approach!",

You'll get a little regression, operations research, time series analysis, etc. Now, you'd think, given the survey nature of the class that the topics would be fairly high level, but they weren't. For regression, for example, we got into things like elastic net, and regularization, etc. Tests were not too bad if you did a reasonable amount of preparation (you were allowed a cheat sheet, both sides). Interestingly, I found that my cheat sheets really didn't help. I found that for most questions, I either knew the answers, or nothing in my notes would have mattered anyway. If you come into this class with no R experience, get ready for a steep learning curve. In my case, I certainly had some basic knowledge, but found that having a copy of \"Introduction to Statistical Learning\" came in handy. \nAt the beginning of the course many people freaked out due to the seemingly steep R learning curve. But, as was pointed out, the homeworks were designed more for learning than testing. As it was, homework counted for relatively little of the grade, and submitting ANYTHING would get you a 50% score. And, since homework only counted for 16% of the grade total, that means you could have done almost nothing and ace the test and come in a 92% course grade. \nHaving said that, I really tried on each homework assignment to do the very best I could. \nAfter the early weeks, the latter part of the course was a bit easier, with the written project more conceptual. \nOverall, good course, certainly increased my confidence in figuring things out with R.

How to carefully break down product costs? Yep. How VCs generally work and how they'd value a startup? Check. How marketers focus on segmentation, targeting, positioning, and those famous 4 P's? Right. What the heck business strategy consultants think about? Roger. None of which I knew before. For that I'm grateful.\n\nHowever, the presentation was extremely dry (like a video textbook, as another reviewer put it) and spent far too much time on minutiae instead of exploring big concepts, applying them on our own (which is how I really learn), or connecting them to analytics. I was expecting at least to do one project-type assignment, such as creating a mock business strategy or marketing plan, but no, that kind of deeper/applied thinking counted squat toward your grade. Instead, to satisfy the gradebook, you had to subject yourself to a merciless grind that I can only describe as memorizing shuffled decks of cards and hand-calculating answers to story problems that combine 7th grade math with financial jargon.",

Your homework assignments occur within a Jupyter Notebook that has test cells that determine whether or not you completed the exercise correctly. Having an issue with something? Then just copy the test cell data into a new cell and use that to debug you code. The set-up of the homework made it feel like they wanted you to succeed and were giving you the framework to do so. I wouldn't take it without some background in code, though - you need to have a foundation that this class builds on.\n\nThe part that challenged me the most was the last few weeks when we dove into the deep end with linear algebra. For someone who does pretty well with math but has never taken a linear algebra course (and thought it was a good idea to skip it...which wasn't in fact a good idea), I got to the point where I was able to complete the assignments, but I'm still a little hazy as to the WHY behind what I was coding. So, I'll be taking the Udacity Linear Algebra refresher suggested by another reviewer.\n\nThe midterms/final were discussed by other reviewers for I won't hash them out. I'll just say that once they got the format figured out (24 hours to complete, open everything), they weren't too bad. It's a challenge for sure, but they were doable.",

I find it to be a pretty finicky programming language, and there were nights where I struggled for an hour or two to figure out what I was doing. By the time I was done, I felt like I had learned a good bit, though, so maybe it was worth it.\n\nHomeworks aren't bad, though a bit time consuming. Midterms/final were a little bit tricky - you really have to sit and think through a question and pick the answer that seems the most right. You get a handwritten cheat sheet for each midterm and 2 of them for the final - and these saved me. But you need to put a lot on them since briefly covered concepts could be on the exams.\n\nProject for the class was simple enough and followed the format of other case studies.\n\nIt's not easy, but you learn a whole lot, and it's a great introduction to what to expect for the rest of the OMSA program.",

There is no curve, and the mid-term and final exams are like sprints, you barely have time to complete them, and a lot of students actually weren't able to complete the mid-term. The extra credit assignment is a joke, it requires more effort to complete than multiple projects combined, and it only contributes to 2% of your total grade. These horrible features of this course make it extremely nerve-racking, because you can easily lose a letter grade in the blink of an eye. It almost seems at times as if the professor dislikes seeing students do good in this course, and he tries really hard to prevent you from earning an A; I was able to earn one in the end, but it wasn't an \"easy A\" at all. I personally avoided asking questions via Reddit, because of the snarky replies the professor would issue to students. The course serves as a good introduction to Machine Learning, and you get to apply Machine Learning to stock trading in the last project, which was awesome.  Something else which you need to consider is the fact that projects build on each other, therefore if you fail to complete a project, or you implement it incorrectly, you will be toast.",

The projects are difficult (would be extremely difficult if your C/C++ background is very limited). Tons of papers to read. The exams are also difficult, though previous exam solutions are extremely helpful. Exam questions don't seem to strictly repeat, but tend to cover the same concepts.\n\nThe workload isn't extreme. I had some experience in C/C++ and most of the projects took 20-30 hours, with the exception of project 4, which is a huge project and took me well over 40 hours. I generally spent 6ish hours on papers and lectures per week.\n\nOverall, the class is informative, well-run, and the projects are useful and interesting.

            "text": "I came into the class already knowing SQL and Spark in scala fairly well, and had taken the rest of the ML specialization already, so take my workload and difficulty ratings with a grain of salt. Here are some things that might be helpful to know:\n- You need to know how to calculate partial derivatives, use the chain rule, etc. You have to derive various update equations and then code them. In other words, if you weren't able to derive the equations, you wouldn't be able to do the entire rest of the homework and would get a terrible score. That could really rain on someone's parade.\n- You are required to use scala for Spark (except on the Group Project). You are not allowed to use pyspark. \n- There are 4 homework assignments and then a group project. No exams.\n- You need to know SQL for most of the homework\n- The first homework uses Pandas and sklearn. The rest do not.\n- The second homework uses Hive, Pig, Map-Reduce, and scala Spark in Zeppelin. You don't need to know Hive, Pig or Map-Reduce very well. Just do the practice lab before the course starts and you will be fine on those.\n- The 3rd and 4th homework are scala Spark. You need to know it pretty well.\n- The 4th homework uses Spark's Graph-X. \n- The Group Project is worth a lot of your grade. A lot of people did projects based on Deep Learning.\n\nWARNING: when testing your homework using their test scripts, do not assume your code is correct if it passes. Their tests are inadequate. Many students complained of having passed all the tests but then losing lots of points.\n\nPros of the course: Great practical experience in big data. The homework was very worthwhile and I enjoyed it.\nCons of the course: This course could be great if anyone on the teaching staff would dedicate even a little bit of effort. They will give you a set up for Zeppelin using Docker that takes many hours to complete and then you find out at the end that the set-up doesn't work, and in fact, when they gave it to you, THEY ALREADY KNEW IT DIDN'T WORK because it didn't work in the previous semesters either. And they still keep handing it out. No respect for students' time whatsoever. The instructions in general are frequently ambiguous or wrong, and no efforts are made to correct them. The TAs make brief appearances on piazza to give 3 word responses that do not answer the question that was asked. The professor of record has no interaction with the class whatsoever -- not even a single piazza post -- except each group for the group projects were allowed to meet with him for 10 minutes over 3 days of his choosing. Then after we all cleared out our schedule for the great honor, at the last minute, he cancelled and told everybody on that day they needed to move to day x. Which of course most of us could not do without any advanced notice. So I never had a single interaction with him. Lastly, the pacing of the course is bizarre -- almost backwards. The more time a homework or task takes, the less time you are given to do it. And the easier it is, the more time you are given to do it. The homework and project are not given out ahead of time so there is no way for students to correct for this.\n\nI still liked the class despite all this in that it really did help me become confident with big data technologies and scala Spark in particular. It just frustrates me to know end that the course could be SO much better with just a little effort.",

The lectures are twenty minute sleeping pills where a menagerie of different professors read slides verbatim and provide long, rambling, and excessive examples to the point of further confusion. The course content is all over the place and seems hastily assembled, as if someone just concatenated four standard-length courses into a Frankenstein's monster of business school intro courses. Grades are few and far between (the two exams count for 70% of the grade), and the professor (the one of four presumably in charge) seems to have little if any grasp on online quiz structure, having involved, high point value multi-step questions for which there is no partial credit (e.g. \"Select the correct eight of these fifteen possible answers\"), and incorrect responses that seem to want to actively trick students into wrong answers instead of guiding the learning process. On Piazza, when the professor chooses to make an appearance, he is usually combative and seems to often resent the sheer audacity of those who may want to actually learn this material. The course would be a poor refresher for those pursuing an MBA, and seems especially inappropriate for those pursuing a degree in computational analytics. Towards the end it became clear that at no point would any of the material actually tie into analytics, making it even further baffling that this course is foundational for the analytics program at Georgia Tech.\n\nFor those considering taking this course, I can simply suggest you put it off as long as possible, in hopes the course will be reworked or removed altogether.\n\nFor those responsible for building and administering OMS programs, I can only say this course is an embarrassment and actively damages the reputation of the OMS community.",

            "text": "So, this is my honest review of the class. The class is not time consuming with the exception of the projects. There are six problems sets (if I don't recall incorrectly), and these are easy to complete because you have the solution available to you and a video that walks you through the code. For the projects, a mini project in addition to three main projects will be given. The projects are very time consuming.  In my opinion, this turns out to be this way because the lectures and material presented in class are effective in showing basic concepts for this class, but fail to expand more into each of those basic concepts to make such material meaningful to solving the projects. Don't get me wrong. Even with the right background, the projects would be hard and time consuming.\n\nGrading of these projects strictly depends on your code being able to pass test cases. If you don't pass any of the test cases, you don't get any marks. It doesn't matter if you have a 1000 line code. That being said, do well in the mini project, project 1 and 2. These projects are doable, and you can get them done in a week or less except for project 2. Spend more time on that one because part b of this project becomes challenging and is code that you can use for project 3. The deadline for dropping classes is right around the same time project 2 is given, so if you flunk project 2 you will not be able to drop the class. It would be better if you could complete project 2 before the drop deadline to be able to better gauge your success in the class. This is something future students should recommend. Project 3 is the hardest. Spend two weeks or more on it. The connection between project 3 and the class material is the least apparent, so you will spend more time figuring out how to proceed with your implementation. Chances are that you will reuse your code from project 2 part b.\n\nThe nice part is that project previews in Piazza usually come a week prior to the release of the projects in t-square. This allows you to work ahead, which helps with organization and project time allocation. So, as soon as you get the project preview, start working on the project.\n\nAs a summary, my recommendation is to 1) Do well in the mini project, project 1 and project 2 to be successful and 2) organize yourself to allocate enough time for each project, and 3) start working on the projects as soon as the project previews become available.",

            "text": "Took this as my first OMSCS class, without prior Python or OpenCV knowledge and sketchy Linear Algebra. It's a great class, hard but for all the right reasons. Very well organized, and a fair grading scheme. No grading on a curve so everyone cooperates on Piazza (within the 'no sharing code' constraint).  I could feel myself learning as the course progressed. Mind blowing feeling to go from knowing nothing, to knowing, uh.. something (Prof. Bobick style joke), and as an added bonus you will develop an internal clock that always knows AoE time. What makes the course hard? The sheer volume of videos to watch and assignments to complete in a short 17 weeks. Here's my time breakdown by week measured by Toggl, so you can schedule your accordingly: 18, 20, 24, 26, 22, 31, 32, 21, 16, 15, 24, 24, 23, 14, 50, 31, 16. That 50 is not from leaving the timer running by mistake - it's the time I packed in attempting to do the final project which I found incredibly difficult. The week before that with only 14 hours was the one I spent flailing around, despairing of being able to do the final project. Advice for others 1. Don't fall behind on watching the lectures! Watch them all before doing the assignments - even without taking notes and/or at 2x speed. They might seem to not be connected to the assignments, but they open up your mind to things that will help you do the assignmets - and certainly will make a big difference preparing for the exam. 2. Start assignments the minute the day they are released. Don't procrastinate because usually success in the assignments (especially if you're a newbie) is more a function of time than anything else. 3. Make an effort to post questions to the Office Hours, or be familiar with the assignment so you can benefit more from them - Mathew Houston's recorded OH were extremely helpful. 4. In the assignments, strive for 100% because the final project is 5 times harder than any assignment and you have only 3 weeks to complete it (took me about 85 hours to turn in something not so great), so it's likely to bring your grade down.\nSome criticism: The assignments have a lot of starter code written for you, so you can learn Python and OpenCV as you go along, however, it would have helped if the Matlab quizzes in the lectures were replaced with OpenCV ones (but Pedro the TA did provide OpenCV versions for some of them). The biggest criticism is that because of the final project, there are no assignments on the later sections and I didn't feel like I really learnt them.",

I did not feel that the final exam tested my knowledge of anything that you might take away from the course.  Also covers quite a few papers that aren't really discussed during lectures.\nTime commitment: If I'm combining the time spent working on assignments with the time to watch lectures, then it's about 20 hours, if not counting the lectures it's a bit less than that.\n\nOverall:  I was thinking about the perception specialization, but this course turned me off to that completely.

However, I come from an embedded background with no UX experience, so all the concepts were new and I needed more time. \nThe strategy that works best is to choose a domain and a problem in that domain that you want to solve and a few apps that you can review. You watch the lecture on a Monday, read the questions to be answered for the assignment, internalize the concept and apply them on everything you do in the next three days, then just reflect on your experience for the questions asked in the assignment.\nWe have two proctored exams and they are a bit tough. Take proper notes while watching the lectures and diligently read all the weekly readings. The readings were made compulsory from Fall 2017 and 1/3 of the questions in the test come from those. As I didn't do the readings, my test scores are not great. \nThis can be easily taken along with another intermediate course, if the other one is full of programming like CV or AI then this writing will complement the heavy programming.",

Assignments also had a concept called Above & Beyond, i never tried A&B, you have to do something extract other than required on that assignment topic to receive A&B which counts for 10 mark. we also had a mid term project which is the replication of an published paper, this was the most difficult assignment of all to me, but if you spend enough time it will be an easy A. we had two attempts at the exam, and exam is easy one but really tricky one, as there are multiple choice questions, if wrong answer selected negative marking is given. choose your final project when you reach mid term itself and start working on it, as much as possible choose an easy topic as you have the liberty to choose the topic.\n\nOver All this class is very good class.",

            "text": "Very well-done course. It's hard to imagine a better introduction to the Analytics program -- you should definitely take this your first semester.  This course does a great job of surveying the world of what most people are calling \"data science\" nowadays -- basic data preparation plus a wide array of both machine learning and traditional statistical modeling techniques. If you put a good amount of time and effort into the homework (and don't just copy the TA office-hour solutions), this class also goes surprisingly deep into some topics.  You WILL want some experience with R prior to the course or you will be spending double the hours/week.  It is also a great idea to get familiar with RMarkdown documents since they are a great format for submitting homework.\n\nAlthough I ended up with an A, my only complaints about the class relate to the grade weighting and some exam questions.  First, the homework and course project are low weight compared to the amount of work required and understanding gained (16% hw, 9% project). In addition, one feels a bit cheated when the course project is merely peer-graded and your peers don't provide much feedback. The peer grading in general was not very helpful as I rarely got any comments, just a numeric score -- I would learn more with tougher HW feedback from an instructor. The exams felt unnecessarily high-pressure and high-stakes, because they were (75% of grade for 3 exams). While about 80% of the exam questions were pretty easy, 5-10% were subtle/difficult, and about 10-15% were just badly constructed -- either expecting us to \"think on our feet\" about applying/combining concepts that only got minimal lecture time, or having ambiguous wording/intent, or relying on a very artificial set-up, or making too many assumptions and providing too little context. Some were major traps for people prone to overthinking.  In addition, the exams leaned toward fewer questions with higher point values each, which can really bite you. Fortunately there's a fairly generous curve that will add 5-6 % points.  In general, if you want a solid pre-curve A, you should do extra reading on each modeling technique covered and your studying should focus more on big-picture, situational application and pros/cons of different techniques. \n\nAll in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned a ton.  Dr. Sokol's lecture videos are engaging and clear, including many examples from his own consulting experience. It's obvious he loves the subject too.",

Should be much easier if one has completed CV. The course load is very well distributed. It had 7 assignments, 2 project work (mid-term research work replication & final project) & one final examination (with upto 2 attempts - max considered :))\nThe TAs are vell organized, very passionate & very helpful too. Despite their own course loads, they were present on piazza (&slack) answering questions; both technical & logistical...\nThe only not-so-positive aspect for me personally was that a significant portion of assignment grades were deteremined by quality of report. This sometimes makes you feel that some technical challenges resolved/attempted were getting overlooked especially if you are not one of those who are good at reporting :).\nHaving completed more rigourous courses like CSE 6220(IPC), CS6601(AI) & CS6476(CV) where the reporting was not a big factor in determing the grades found this a little discouraging. But on the brighter side, it's gave an opportunity for me to improve on these aspects (which is definitely important in professional life).\nOver & above the computation part, the fun aspect was experimenting with photography... I used the opportunity to get myself a nice SLR (not mandatory for the course) & learnt quite a bit of photography during the last 4 months.\nIf you need a term break from the heavy load ones & want to have some fun along with learning, will recommend this course.

Ok, bleeding-edge might be a bit of a stretch, but you will learn something new :-).  Also, fair warning to those considering this as your first class. This class can take a lot of time depending on your background. Don't let the average workload fool you. My background academic experience consisted of predominately electrical engineering courses sprinkled with skeleton computer science code problems during my undergraduate program. My current job is a System Administrator and I hardly touch code. I can definitely say I this class took a lot of time due to my background. If you are like me and you don't have a decent amount of software development experience, I would recommend taking SDP before this class. You definitely don't have to take Software Development Process before this one to excel, but I believe SDP would give you the exposure of typical bugs software engineers/software developers would encounter. This exposure would give the student a deeper appreciation of techniques presented in this course. I believe anyone can take this class and do well if you work hard; however, to shave off time of some of the projects it will serve you well to have a solid grasp of C/C++ i.e pointers, pass-by-reference, STL, etc. and Java, some graph theory terminology i.e. node, edge, path, directed etc, algorithms of common data structures such as trees, linked lists, and arrays, very basic probability and statistics, and all of the common operations from Set Theory. If you decide not to brush up in these areas you can still do well, but it may be a bit of a struggle.  If you have questions during the course, don't be afraid to ask the instructors, they won't bite :-). If I had done this for the first couple of projects of the course, I more than likely would have had a better outcome.  What can I say? This was my first rodeo so I had to live and learn. Exams are very hard and will require a good bit of study time to do well. For my class, they provided a very watered-down version of the exams as a review and that helped a lot. This was my first of two classes in the OMS program and I did learn a lot. Hopefully, this review will be of some help to you and I wish you the best in your future endeavors with this program.

This course provided a refresh on calculus and linear algebra which I guess is useful when I get deeper in ML. I also took this course to learn R as a new language, which I think the course material did a good job on that, but maybe too much as it seems like it assumes minimum background in coding. So if you, like me, are a professional developer for years, you may find it boring.\n\nThe workload is light, only exception is the first project which you need to do some partial derivatives and implement a logistic regression model using R from scratch. The requirement wasn't clear until couple of days before the deadline, which makes it hard if you want to finish it early on you own pace. But since most of the HW and projects are due early Monday mornings, you have good chance to spend your weekend and should be able to get it done. I still remember the last project which is due the Monday after thanksgiving and I had to bring laptop with me and did some coding while on vacation in Fairebanks, Alaska. It was good memory though :)\n",

I have a degree in computer science and 4 semesters of calculus, but still could not decipher the mathematical formulas we were given to implement our code.  I easily spent 40+ hours a week, 20+ hours spent trying to decipher the assignment.  Some people claimed they finished assignments (even the final!) in 3 days - I spent every spare minute on my computer from the minute assignments were released to the hour the assignment was due, and I was still lucky to get a B.\nThe course is great, really.  I loved watching the videos, and you learn some fantastic state-of-the-art stuff, like sensing road signs for self-driving cars, to how to create special effects like you see in the movies.  The difficulty comes from being asked to implement these things using just the math.  You've introduced to the topic, the theory explained, the math given and explained, and then off you go!  The problem is that none of that gives you an algorithm to implement.  I found it incredibly frustrating to interpret the math, and in the end had to conclude half of it was nonsense, unless that large 'E' symbol means something other than sum, and every time they ask you to subtract the mean (average), they are just kidding.\n\nIn the end the only reason I passed was because I ignored the formulas, looked at code off the internet, and got the source code for the openCV functions we weren't allowed to use, and painstakingly over several days, went line-by-line through the dense C++ code, figured out what it was doing, where it matched with the formula we were given, where it didn't, and rewriting everything into python.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of time, don't take this course.  You cannot skip a lecture, and will probably end up watching all of them several times, rewinding to go over some dense explanation.  If, however, you do have the time, want to learn some amazing skills, and can decipher mathematical equations with ease, you will love this course.",

There were about 30 hours of lectures which seems like more than some of the other classes in the program.  It's important to watch them before working on assignments since the implementation steps for some of the problem sets are directly given in the lectures.  The TAs were great at releasing the problem sets and grades on a regular 2 week schedule.  Matthew Houston also gave well prepared office hours that he recorded weekly which were very helpful.  The final project had 5 possible topics and requires a lot of work; my advice is to limit your scope initially because you may otherwise try something too ambitious and not be as pleased with your results.  The open note final was pretty straightforward.  Taking CP first was very helpful for me since I hadn't touched python in a decade and I wrote more code for the traffic sign detection problem set than I did in all of CP (including my final project).  The overlap in some of the topics with CP also helped me feel more comfortable in completing the CV problem sets.  I really enjoyed the class and wish there were more CV classes to take.",

            "text": "There has been so much said already about the course that I don't feel the need to go into details, but I'll just say that this was my favorite course so far in my OMSCS journey.  The material is vast, but the goal is to give you high level understanding of a broad set of tools.  Specifically, the professors focus on what certain algorithms do, what specific algorithms are good and bad at, intuition behind how they work, and how they are similar and different from other algorithms.  The focus is NOT on how to implement each individual algorithm or how to use specific ML tools and frameworks.  I heard or read at some point (maybe even during a lecture?) that one of the goals of the class is to provide students the tools to become ML researchers.  I think this course does a great job at that, while also giving students the opportunity to pick up specific tools as they desire.\n\nIn my opinion, it helps to take DVA before this class if you are not coming from an ML background.  Even if you don't use the R language for the assignments in this course, that class can get you in the right mindset for what kinds of plots and plot-layouts to put into a report to make the best use of your limited space.  Also, that course goes into some detail on logistic and linear regression.  While those topics are not covered in detail in this course, that discussion is still a good primer for topics in this course, including things like brushing up on rusty linear algebra skills and learning to do write vectorized code.",

The first run of this midterm project I feel did not provide sufficient time or feedback, which will hopefully be improved on in the future. Make sure you get started on it as soon as it is released.  There is an 'artsy' component to this class, where you have to deal with taking good pictures and then talking about how you took them well in the reports. Personally, I didn't like the subjectivity of it. \nThe most disheartening aspect of this course is that you must make up something to get more than 90% on any given assignment. What must you make up, you ask? That's a good question, as I am done with the course and still haven't figured it out. \nThe final exam was open book with two attempts, however it doesn't test that you actually know something. It's more of a needle in haystack search where you have to 'select all correct choices'. \nTAs were quite helpful throughout. Video lectures were pretty high level and didn't get into the meat of the algorithms, which made them relatively poor in my opinion. \nIf you are doing the Computational Perception specialization, you have no choice but to take this. If you have decided on any other specialization, just take Computer Vision and you would have covered a large majority of this course, with a much greater depth of understanding of the math and algorithms as well. You will learn more in depth, you won't have to make up things to get a solid A on any given assignment, and you can avoid the subjective artsy experience if that's not your thing. ",

            "text": "OMS Analytics Admin - If you are reading this, please, for the sake of the program and even for Georgia Tech as a school, do not offer this course in its current state, ever again. It is a disgrace to student taking time away from busy life and want to learn something useful. \n\nI hated this class with a passion. I got an A out of this class so this is nothing personal. But boy was I disappointed.       \n\nThis is going to be long. Here’s the tl;dl: If you hold a business degree in either undergrad or MBA, definitely absolutely opt-out of it. You won’t learn anything new. If you can’t opt-out, perhaps wait until they rework this class. With the numerous negative reviews I think/hope they will have to do something about it.        \n\nHere we go…       \n\nFirst I should say I don't have a problem with learning accounting, costing, finance, marketing, strategy. In fact I still consider the very existence of business classes in the curriculum to be one of the highlights of Georgia Tech’s analytics degree program. But this class is just horrible. It has “Analytics” in the name, is one of the few (3?) classes created specifically for the analytics program (all others are existing classes from other majors). But throughout the class the professors hadn’t mentioned it even once, except perhaps the couple of times when they referred to us. They did not even attempt to relate the material to analytics at all. And it shouldn’t be difficult. I don’t expect them going into much detail on the “how” – that’s for the next class, but it should be very easy to at least mention areas of application. For example, in valuation there was this comparable method, in marketing there was market segmentation and evaluation of advertising. All have obvious links to analytics. They could have just spent a minute linking them to analytics concepts like clustering, design of experiment, etc. But nope there was none of that.        \n\nAnd then there was the teaching itself, which was a complete opposite of the awesome ISYE6501 where the videos were concise, to the point and easy to follow. This class had long (10-15 mins) videos where the professors were just reading from the scripts. A couple professors at least make some better PowerPoints slides, but the last professor would put a whole paragraph of text on the slide while he talk on and on. On the forum the professors (mostly just the main one since he was the one who interacted with us) were not exactly helpful. They could get impatient and defensive really fast. They probably thought we were either asking stupid question or trying to be smartasses. Their attitude really discourage learning. They could even get borderline rude. There was this one time when a student asked for clarification on one of the frameworks, and he would say, and I quote: \"Why don’t you google John Kotter read more about his approach\". Go figure.        \n\nEven worse was the homework and exams. For machine grading purposes, just about everything was multiple choice, with no chance of partial credits. You would be asked to do multi-step problems that involved creating a balance sheet or multi-year NPV calculation (by hand In exams!). If you made one single mistake you would lose all points – it could amount to a whole point (homework) or even 3 points (exam) on your *course* grade. Other non-math problem tended to ask about the tiniest detail of the material. There were also select-all-true (and sometime all-false! Better be careful!) from 5-10 boxes and again they were all-or-nothing. All of these made the homework and exams very stressful.        \n\nAgain, my grade turned out ok. But I just hated wasting 3 credit hours on this class when there are so many interesting electives out there. Avoid it at all costs unless/until you hear better reviews in the future.",

Experience in KBAI from last summer helped me wee little. Looking back, I should have taken CP class before KBAI. exam. My only criticism, is this class seems to bite more than we can chew at times, lectures are over-packed and at times. Video lectures sometimes become too much \"illustrative\", and some of the useful details seem to get left out, when the lectures say this is just for the illustrative purposes. And because of this, you might understand how something works, but might not always understand why something works. I loved the idea of Above and Beyond (A&B) in the assignment, it did seem to align well with the spirits of the masters' degree. If you are planning to go with CP&R specialization, definitely take CP before CV. I am coming from 6+ yrs of professional C# and .NET experience, but regardless, I definitely would recommend some good practice with Python, NumPy and OpenCV, bring down your workload. The assignments are not that hard, but they might seem challenging at times. I found the midterm project (Seam Carving) challenging. The class let's you pick your own final project, so you can truly make the most out of this class. Final exam was neither too hard nor too easy. Do read the question twice, in the final test. I expect them to lower the velocity. I did not always appreciate when the videos ignore some of the necessary details. Overall, stay consistent, do the the exercises, spend time reading the white papers. Take the time to read the white papers. there are a TON OF WHITE PAPERS TO READ, which might seem overwhelming, but do not forget you are a graduate student, at Georgia Tech. Fun fact: in the Udacity video lectures, the processor utters the word \"of course\" 1395 times.",

He is basically what would happen if you had Donald Trump run a business class. The OMSA program and Georgia Tech should all do themselves a favor and just fire this man.  He is toxic. He is disgustingly rude. He is about as personable as the Ebola Virus. If you misunderstand any concept that is ambiguous in the class, it cannot possibly be his problem, it must be that the students are morons. Or the students just are not getting it. But it is never his issue, it is always ours. If we do have the audacity to say he has done something wrong, instead of admitting his error, he will double down on his wrongness. He gets unnecessarily defensive. I am in complete awe of how a man with such a disgusting behavior is any where close to an academic institution. This man is a disgrace and an embarrassment to Georgia Tech. He runs the class like a prison. He thinks it is better for the homeworks to be these all-or-nothing multiple choice questions that do not help with learning, but test what you have learned through the videos. I feel like he made this class unnecessarily difficult, purposefully. I think he has some deep-rooted Napoleonic Complex that he needs to get checked out by a psychologist.

It was interesting to learn of many concepts that were \"ahead of their time\" and just now coming into mainstream given cloud and data center technologies.  \n\nThe projects were slightly harder than average difficulty and required good knowledge of C++ (in particular C++ 11). Coming from a C++/embedded background this was not too difficult, but given some of the Piazza posts many had problems in this area.  Most projects had \"multi-threaded\" attributes, so a good understanding of threads is a good thing to know coming into the class.  Nonetheless, all the projects had a high \"learning value\", introducing us to several technologies I haven't been exposed to (but expect to put into practice).\n\nThe assigned readings were also voluminous, with many of them supporting the lectures. Plan to spend countless hours reading these papers. Several details of the papers were asked on the midterm and/or final exams, so this is not an optional component of the class. Most of the papers were actually quite informative, though some went into a lot of details and performance evaluations, which could've been summarized in just a few sentences (I mostly just skimmed these sections and got the necessary information our of the summary).\n\nBy far, the most challenging aspect of the course were the midterm and final exams, which together comprised 42% of the overall grade. These tests were quite simply \"hard\". The tests did not exactly focus on the facts learned during the course, but instead on whether the student understood the concepts/facts and could make additional deductions on those facts.  The exams, while still performed in Verificent/Proctortrack were all essay type questions. Even the True/False questions required an explanation in order to get credit.  The exams were definitely comprehensive over the material.\n\nThe lectures were actually quite good. The professor took the time to convey key concepts, including examples and details. Of course, his lectures were primarily an overview with examples of the assigned readings. The TAs were quite helpful and responsive on Piazza.\n\nPerhaps the only negative (I consider the \"difficulty of the course a positive) was that the projects took a long time to be graded.  At midterm (i.e., time to withdraw), only about 30% of the grades had been posted.  This may have been caused by significant events during the early part of the semester (Hurricane Irma, Harvey and Katia) that impacted a lot of students (and in the case of Irma the Atlanta campus).  A special 1 time \"late forgiveness\" policy was however, introduced to accommodate those impacted by these storms.  I was a little disappointed in that the course did not go into more \"kernel level\"  OS details, but stayed a little higher level detailing how OS support newer technologies such as security, data centers and distributed computing systems, which seems to be more of the trend.\n\nI would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in distributed systems. Don't be misled into believing that the course is just an advanced undergraduate OS type course. You'll learn a lot in this course, but you'll also work hard to do well and be glad you took it (after it's over).",

There is no helpfulness or positive encouragement provided in learning. Lots of negative responses and sarcasm. First, you need to search and read through all piazza posts before asking your question (to avoid annoying the TAs). Second, you didn't get a straight answer most of the time, so might as well do the research yourself. My take on group project: there will always be someone who doesn't do any work. With that in mind, always focused on your own learning and not worry with what other people do or don't. If you're lucky to find good people, it's a bonus!  if not, that's okay too.

            "text": "This class is definitely a basic introduction to machine learning, with more of the class focused on using NumPy and Pandas and a few financial markets topics.  In terms of difficulty, most of the projects are very straightforward, and Professor Balch provided additional videos that walked through pseudo code or algorithm outlines.  Two of the projects are more challenging, but still reasonable.  I would have preferred that some of the early easy projects be combined to allow for an additional machine learning project at the end.  The huge class size (~700 in the online portion) exposed that there are limits to how high a class can be scaled before execution problems emerge.  This class pairs well with other classes, as long as attention is paid to the higher workload in the last few weeks of the class.\n\nPROS:\n\n--Lectures were clear.\n\n--Professor Balch was active on Reddit nearly everyday.\n\n--The material was interesting and a good example of how machine learning is applied in a single industry.\n\n--There seems to be some measure of updates and improvements each semester, so there is an effort to refine the course over time.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n--The amount of lecture material is light, particularly in the second half of the course.\n\n--Management of the course was often sloppy.  For example, the course started a few days late, project requirements sometimes weren't \"finalized\" until a few days before the due date, important clarifications of project expectations were sometimes contained in a single post buried in the Reddit megathreads that were hundreds of posts deep, messages to the class were infrequent or incomplete, it was often impossible to submit a project to T-Square until two days before the due date, wording of exam questions was often vague, and the checks for course participation were essentially abandoned halfway through the course.\n\n--There was very little feedback on projects.\n\n--The grading was slow for some of the auto-graded projects and participation quizzes.\n\n--It was a challenge to search the Reddit megathreads that were often several hundred comments deep.\n\n--Professor Balch's tone on Reddit sometimes didn't come across as very encouraging.\n\n--Some of the additional assigned shows or movies (e.g. The Big Short) weren't at all relevant to machine learning.\n\n--The answer key used to score the final exam had two incorrect answers (Professor Balch eventually acknowledged one mistake, but stood behind the other even though it directly contradicted an assigned video).\n\n--Professor Balch's frequent references to Monty Python are distracting and could be confusing to those that aren't native English speakers.",

            "text": "Ok, without too much lyrics here is what you need to do in order to succeed in this class:\n\n1. Become good at dynamic programming! This one is the most important and the hardest. Learn how to solve typical most common problems like LIS, LCS etc. Get Dasgupta algorithms book and start solving DP problems (chapter 6). Learn how to write a recurrence and pseudocode for them using pencil and paper! Once you are comfortable - go to leetcode, or hackerrank and practice them as much as you can. Code them if you want, but keep in mind that you'd have to be able to HANDWRITE your solutions!\n\n2. Learn about roots of unity in the context of Fast Fourier Transform. To be more precise - understand, how to multiply 2 integers using FFT Divide&Conquer approach. This one is also one of the most challenging topics. The lectures are good, but assuming you know the basics, which I didn't, so I had to dig all over the internet to understand it.\n\n(If you are good with 2 things above - you'll most likely succeed. Other stuff is also important, but not as much as previous 2. You'd still have to practice all of it, but other topics a bit easier to grasp.)\n\n3. Brush up on modular arithmetic, RSA cryptosystem and all the theory behind it.\n\n4. Learn the basics of the graph theory: paths, flows, spanning trees, DFS, BFS, SCC, Djkstra etc.\n\n5. Don't worry too much about proving problems to be NP-complete, those are fairly straightforward, although, practicing wouldn't hurt at all.\n\n6. Practice linear programming problems, but only after you are good at 1 and 2 (or if 3rd exam is approaching).\n\n7. Make sure you have enough time for the entire semester, and don't hope for the last night preparation. It won't work, unless you are already pro in all the topics above. \n\n8. Do all the homeworks, and do them EARLY!!! They are hard, although worth almost nothing in terms of grade. Doing them is crucial for quality exam preparation, and if you don't do them - you're screwed!\n\n9. Do not rush dropping the course if you screw up on the first exam. There will be plenty of opportunities to catch up, at last you can drop with W after the 2nd exam (if nothing changes next semesters).\n\nThe course is absolutely amazing, and it will develop your brain big time. The lectures are of the highest quality and very helpful. So, work hard, be optimistic, and good luck!\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

Listening to the weekly lectures and taking notes alone took me about 10 to 15 hours per week because I had to rewatch them several times to fully understand the topics. Doing the homework took about 5 hours or more per week. And, I spent about 20 hours or more per week to work on extra problems and reading. And so, on average, this class took me about 35 to 40 hours of studying per week. Can you do with much less amount of time? Absolutely! But it depends on a few factors. First, it depends on your goal: are you okay with a B (I'm not; I want my A)? I know some students who spent 10 to 15 hours a week, but were struggling to get into the B range or were solidly in the B range. Second, it depends on your background: are you familiar with the topics already (I'm not) or are you the brilliant type (I'm not; I have to work hard to get my As)?\n\nThe exams were hard but fair. They weren't tricky, but you absolutely need to be careful lest you'd make silly mistakes. But, from personal experience, and from what I gathered from Piazza, it was almost inevitable that people would make small mistakes, some of which had disproportionately large deductions, and so don't kick yourself too hard when you do make those types of mistakes.\n \nTake my review with a grain of salt. I'm the type who pushes myself very, very hard to fully master everything about anything, and I strive for the high scores in my classes, which I did in this class.",

In all other courses, we will get to do the projects where we get 1-2 weeks of time where we can figure out what needs to happen. In this course, we need to figure out in 3 hours of exam time. The exams are similar to homework but home works are not easy either, But you will get a week to figure out for homework where as exams can be very tricky. The professor won't ask any questions that does not make you think. He makes you think a lot during the course. The professor gives a lot of good hints on what to focus on during exam times. They are very very important. Pay close attention to what he says. He is very active on piazza and answers a lot of questions. The professor is very particular about dynamic programming. If you do well in this area, you will get A or B. Otherwise difficult to pass. He asks tough questions of Dynamic programming. It is his favorite part of the course. He initially scared the class saying that if we don't do well n dynamic programming, we will not pass. That happened to be true. This class required at-least 30-40 hours of work for me. So, my advice is not take this class with any other course\n\nThe positive thing about the course is, the curve. The B cut-off was 65% and A cut-off was 84% for Fall 2017.  Believe me, 65% is  not easy to get.. But the curve really helps at the end of the course. The text book used for the course is DPV- Algorithms (Dasgupta + Papapi........+Vazirani). Practice ALL problems from the exercise of this book to pass this course. This is a MUST.  Good luck.",

Homework assignments were relatively easy, projects should be started well in advance.  Reading external material helps a lot, and David Silver's lectures felt more detailed for the intro to the course. Recommendation: be intimate with Python; the later projects are much easier to complete in it. All around, the TAs were very helpful in office hours, and Slack becomes your best friend.

I personally spent around 15 - 20 hours during the first few weeks of the course and steadily was able to reduce my time to around 8-12 hours towards the last month or so. The readings are lengthy at times and there are multiple to get through. I found it hard to digest and remember the opinions of each author/researcher, but getting through the readings helped me to better understand the theory behind HCI and the many views around it. Coming from a computer science undergrad and working in industry as a software engineer for several years, this class definitely helps as I have been on the UI/UX side more times then I can count and it's an area that I find doesn't get enough attention in many of the companies I worked with.

The EER diagrams, schema design, and normalization content is useful. Read a book and don't take the course if that's what you're looking to learn. If you haven't done web development, you will learn a lot from the final project which is a web application. The database component is a decent component to the project, but there's a lot of unnecessary UI requirements. Many requirements are arbitrary and not relevant to the database (i.e. drop downs, radio buttons, printable pages, unit conversion).\n\nProject was terrible. It wasn't reviewed for accuracy or the actual technical requirements that students were supposed to get from it. It was refined over the semester, and felt like the instructional team was making it up along the way, which led to a lot of questions on Piazza. No rubrics were provided for the three project phase submissions. Grading is inconsistent. I had a great group, which made it bearable. Choose your group wisely and try to find others that can complement your skills for the project. There's a team formation period so use that time wisely to find others who are motivated and engaged.\n \nExams were fair for the most part. The last exam was pretty tough as some of the questions, especially calculation questions on indexes, efficiency, and performance weren't like those found in the book or sample exam. Still possible to do well if you think through it carefully. Be prepared for 1-2 questions that don't cover the content assigned in the syllabus. Be prepared for 1-2 tricky questions per exam that assess small details that aren't relevant or core to the course material.\n\nInstructors were not responsive. The head TA was pretty defensive in some initial threads which didn't create a welcoming or positive learning environment on Piazza. Many Piazza threads were never answered, including exam questions and project requirements. The instructor asked for feedback in the middle of the course (which many students appreciated including myself) after some students communicated about the negativity on the forums and the somewhat artful deception of the few exam questions I mentioned before. Most of those threads went unanswered even after the instructor said he'd follow up with individual responses.  \n  \nHope positive changes actual take place in future offerings. I'd recommend the class for those uninitiated with web and SQL. A lot of people already familiar with databases tend to not like the course.",

To be honest, I really liked the instructors and their teaching style. In fact, that is the only reason why I liked this class. I used to keep listening to their lectures again and again until the concepts got deeply embedded in my brain. The instructors provide the students with a good overview of the theory and derivations both through lectures and piazza materials, but the students are not tested on those in any of the assignments. The midterms and finals were not that difficult, provided the students get accustomed to the structure of the questions beforehand. One way to do that is to solve all assignments of the past Machine Learning courses taught at CMU as well as the exercise problems from Tom Mitchell's book that do not require any derivation or proofs. I did all my assignments in JAVA using Weka Library and BURLAP, although Python would have been a better option. Assignments were easy yet time-consuming. In most universities, Machine Learning courses offered by the CS department turn out to be a blend of theory, derivations, analysis and quality code execution, where most students are tested on those. Here students are graded ONLY on analysis. In fact, students are provided with the code or the software for all assignments. I did not enjoy the assignments, as I did not find those challenging enough. If the students are serious about understanding the lectures, then they need to ensure to have a basic grasp on Big O Analysis, Differential Calculus and Probability Theory before taking this course.",

The tests were tough but representative of assignments and lecture materials.  The assignments used a variety of programming languages (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and gave insight to the usage of the techniques from the lectures.  The assignments at first pass came across as difficult but after reviewing the assignment instructions in more detail, the instructors gave plenty of hints and suggestions of how to proceed.\nThe use of Piazza as a forum made getting information from instructors, TAs and fellow students simple and convenient.  The instructors were responsive and helpful as were the TAs.  Additionally, using Office Hours linked to a Piazza post with times into the recorded videos made finding answers to questions convenient and relatively pain-free.\nSince this was my first course in the program I don't have much basis for comparison, but I can't think of much that could have made this course better.",

Even after reading all the reviews and professor's push, delayed to start the assignment and the price was paid in the assignment marks. I finished running all the experiments but didn't have time to write the analysis for which the assignment is graded. Write up is the key. Do not stress much on interesting data sets. Choose two data sets with different type of attributes, <30 in number and with <5000 instances. This will help in running the experiments faster and saving up time for analysis. Later I could score really well in rest of the assignments. Assignments constitute 50% of the grade. Midterm and final constitute rest 50% with equal proportion. Mid term was 1.5 hrs long and final was 3 hrs. Mid term is made purposefully lengthy. It had all T/F questions with 2 points each in the beginning for which a small explanation is required. Later there were 12-20 points questions. So time management is crucial for Midterm. Final had the similar pattern with double amount of time and it was fine. The exams do not require to memorize the proofs or complex equations but basic ones. I have used the following tools/libraries for assignments. 1. WEKA (Java IDE) 2. ABAGAIL (Java) 3. SCIKIT-LEARN (Python) 4. BURLAP (Java). It is better to start the assignment early and to get familiarized with the libraries. Its better to decide on the type of graphs to be produced and stick to them. I always got tempted to include more graphs but ended up not using them due to 10 pages space constraint. It is better to focus on important graphs and good analysis. Guidelines or sample analysis won't be available. It is better to read some papers and follow the format. I could only go through the videos after a point but not the readings, still managed to get an A and felt able to synthesize the content is good enough. Overall, a great course for which we feel accomplished after completing. ",

I had not much prior experience but going through the required pillow library once helped a lot. Overall, a normal yet time consuming course to start the program with.

They were terrible.  They never answered the questions at hand.  It's as if they simply sought to get credit for answering questions in a perfunctory fashion, not elaborating on the answers beyond what was mentioned in class.  \n\nExams were tough in the sense that they required VERY specific memorization.  You couldn't miss an iota of information to get a decent score.  And the exams did NOT allow for partial credit, despite questions in the form of \"select the options below that...\"  So, if you don't know the 4 correct ambiguous answer choices, you don't get any credit.  \n\nThis course embodies not practicing what they preach:  A chunk of the course focuses on \"Strategy & Innovation\" and they preach about companies who couldn't adapt.

This was a little easier for me since I have supported networks that run BFS/DFS and I had a working knowledge of some algorithms.  Finally, NP-Complete and Linear Programming.

First, I have to state that Dr. Isbell, and the TAs: Amir, Sasha, and Pushkar, were extremely helpful throughout this rough journey.  This was a crazy semester for me, and I am sure for others as well, with the hurricanes that affected us: Irma and Maria.  I actually had to complete one of the assignments while running on a portable gas-powered generator, because the electricity was out at my house due to hurricane Irma; where there's a will there's a way.  With a wife, kids, full-time job, putting up hurricane shutters at my house and my parents, being without electricity for a few days, driving all over Miami to find gasoline and propane, and taking Machine Learning for Trading along with this course, this was one hectic semester.  In the end, I miraculously earned an A in both courses.  I must say that I learned a lot in this Machine Learning course, I came into it clueless about Machine Learning, and can say that I acquired a plethora of information in the end.  Dr. Isbell and Dr. Littman cover Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning throughout this course, at a somewhat deep level, which was great.  Grading is harsh, but don't let this discourage you, just give it all you've got and do not give up.  Complete all assignments and the problem sets, and study hard for the midterm and final.

They can be time consuming, especially the latter projects. Especially if you're not familiar or comfortable working in C and a Linux (or unix-like) environment. A lot of other students seemed to struggle with the basics of settings up the environments needed to complete the projects.\n* For midterm and final definitely use previous midterms/finals as study material. Most of the questions are derivatives of previous years, or sometimes the same just worded slightly differently.\n* Read the papers! Read over every paper at least once to help gain insight into the topics discussed in the lecture videos.  And read the papers before the lecture videos.\n* Final course grade is curved. Everyone seemed to do mediocre or not-great on the final and midterm exams, but doing well on the projects and completing the rest of the assignments will help ensure a good grade out of the course.",

The course is compared to a PHD in structure, not necessarily rigor, and I learned a lot about the academic development process. The strongest aspect is this class is the organization and communication which is led by Dr. Joyner. His planning makes it very easy to focus on the content of the course and if you do have questions, answers are swift and sincere. The format is unique in that you are assigned a mentor who guides you through the process of deciding on a project and fulfilling the requirements. There aren't any strong negatives in the course but I suppose the initial project dive is a little rough. There is just so much data to sort through and it is a little hard to pick the problem you want to solve. Fortunately, if you come in to the program with a problem in mind this is a non-issue!\n\nDifficulty:\nThis class is what you make of it. You could pick an really easy problem or a really hard problem, the only person you're hurting or helping is yourself.The first few assignments are almost entirely reading academic articles so get good at reading those efficiently. The writing is not that hard as long as you stay on point and have a purpose. My initial project idea was too ambitious but I was able to massage it into something that could be completed in about 100 hours which is the goal. \n\nWorkload:\nI spent a lot of time reading throughout the entire course so that never really goes away.

These lectures gloss over some details which force you to read the book which has moments of utility but is by and large, a jargon-riddled dumpster fire. The book uses some dreamed up syntax to express some of the algorithms which is pretty taxing to understand. The best approach is just to re-write the algorithm in code into you get the results you expect. The homework is very difficult because the questions are vague but expect precise answers. Fortunately, if you head my advice for dealing with the text book, you can use the same approach and produce code to solve your homework. You don't get credit for the code but it certainly make producing nice LaText and reduces the chance of you transliterating something in your process. If you can explain your approach, you might be able to retain some points but overall, the homework grading is very strict. The coding portion of the project is massive. Absolutely massive. I think it should have been split into at least 3 projects but that may have slowed the class down and there is a lot of ground to cover. I have no complaints about the project grading or what they asked of us. The project document is pretty vague and you have to interpret and justify a lot of your design decisions, just like in real life :)\n\nThe final was not fun and was pretty much like the homework. Treat the homeworks like a practice exam in order to get a feel for the final. The final grading has a decent curve so don't give up, always submit at least something. The way the assignments are weighted, you can't afford to skip any single task.",

Professor Isbell does not care about using other people's codes as long as they are cited.. take advantage of this and take the extra time on your research and writeup. Both midterm and final exams are difficult. The midterm exam in particular is designed not to be finished so don't worry if you didn't do well. Professor Isbell really cares about \"synthesising\" the learned material. Make sure to review the lectures. I did above average on both exams and managed an A by reviewing the lectures two to three times (despite not reading any reading material). Also, do not procrastinate... class starts off slow, but quickly accelerates and reaches a work-load peak during assignment 2, midterm, and assignment 3. You should be fine as long as you put in the time. In summary, PUT IN THE TIME AND DO NOT GIVE UP.",

The arrangement of the topics (DP then Graph then P/NP) front loaded the difficulty somewhat so it wasnt too much for me to recover after not doing well on the first exam.

The programming assignments are graded on how fast they run on a high-performance computing cluster. The course material covers parallelization on a shared memory system, distributed computing, and cache performance, and I felt like the class provided a good general intro to these topics.\n\nDr. Vuduc is clearly a passionate educator. He's good at illustrating many of the difficult HPC concepts. The lecture videos have high production quality. The class was well organized and the Piazza/Slack interactions were engaging.\n\nCSE 6220 was my first OMSCS course. I knew it was going to be challenging, but it was harder than I'd hoped. I found the midterm and final to be difficult and grueling. The exams are mostly theoretical / analytical while the labs are obviously practical. There seemed to be a disconnect between these two components of the course. The harder labs took a large amount of time, and I'm not sure how much additional time/energy would have been required to do really well on the exams. That said, if you do well on the labs, you can still get an A even with middling performance on the exams.\n\nI took this course to fulfill a foundational requirement, to challenge myself, and to get exposure to HPC. I came into the class with some light experience in C. I had to spend a lot of time on the labs wrestling with C issues that a more experienced C programmer wouldn't have. I also didn't have strong algorithmic analysis background, which made it difficult to follow some of the analysis portions. Overall it was a hard but good course.

The class was a good introduction to a lot of OS concepts, and gave a decent survey of more modern concepts that many would consider to be application or domain-specific (e.g. data centers).  The material was lopsided in that the final part of the semester was much more in-depth than the beginning, and hence the final exam had many more pain-points of memorization than the midterm.  The projects were very illustrative of the concepts (I wish we'd had project 2, whatever that was) and didn't fall into the trap of being application-specific.  Strongly recommend C programming background, familiarization with GDB, and (probably) a solid understanding of the Linux filesystem and make paradigm.  As mentioned in other reviews, beware the details on the exams, and try your best to memorize graphs and charts as presented (they ended up being around 15-20% of the grade on the exams and are NOT re-presented as graphics during the exams).\n",

            "text": "Overall a great class and a must take for the first semester. As all great things it did have its ups and downs.\n\nIn this class you will learn about: processes and process management, threads and concurrency, scheduling, memory management, inter process communication and various sync constructs, i/o, virtualization, remote procedure calls, distributed file systems, distributed shared memory, and some datacenter technologies.\n\nYou will get to implement a multithreaded getfile client/server, proxy, cache, and play with an RPC (this semester's was Sun's RPC) think how awesome all of these would look on your resume, also you'll be able to answer all of the AOS prereg question list https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/cs6210_diagnostic-preparedness-test.pdf. If your goal is to eventually take AOS, HPC, HPCA then this class would get you in great shape for them.\n\nThe lectures are great and require no outside readings to understand the material, professor Ada was very active on Piazza and held office hours regularly, and the TA's were friendly and very responsive on both Piazza and Slack. \n\nThe tricky part of the class were the exams, particularly the final which had more material than the midterm on it. So I suggest you study hard for it. There are some (few) papers to read through, but you can get through these fairly easy as there's few and concise.\n\nKEY to this class is to make sure you start the projects on time, the first project in particular is trickier than the others. The more time you spend on it and the better you do on this first project will be worth it in the long run. For each of the projects you have about 1 month to complete which is more than enough.\nI didn't do as good on this first project, because I started it very late, but managed to do good on the last two. So even if you don't do as good on the first one don't fret, you can still do great in the class!\n\nSome C will be good to know coming in, but I think that if you work hard you can pull it off with minimal knowledge, you just need to attack that first project really hard. If you're familiar with pointers, double pointers, function pointers, and using typedef and structs, then you're golden. If not then take the Lynda.com C classes (comes free for students) or grab the K&R C book and go through it (there's also a k&r c solutions book that can be bought for the solutions for the exercises) you can get those for under 20$ if you look hard enough, but just understanding the aforementioned will be enough and wouldn't take more than a few days of stack overflowing and testing on your own to get.\n\nMake sure you're on Slack since Day 1, you can learn a lot about the projects and get hints on them by lurking in the channels. This semester we had a PAID Slack workspace thanks to one of the TA's, how cool is that? To top it all this semester there were some pretty funny characters on it which made lurking enjoyable, however there's always the usual troll tho in there, but hey it's still a great resource.\n\nTL;DR: Just go for it; great class, doable/rewarding projects, friendly/active TA's, very active instructor, very C, such Threads, many Science, WOW.",

Do notice that each project is tagged as Easy, Moderate, Challenging, and Very Challenging. That's based on Professor's own experience, and MAY NOT suit your case. For me, the hardest project is manual_strategy, which was labeled as merely Moderate, while the Very Challenging one feels like a breeze. So, don't assume the time it requires for each project has a direct correlation with the difficulty labels. You may put yourself in an awkward situation. \n\nAnd regarding the exams, you'll need to answer 30 multi-choices within 35 minutes. You might argue about the limited time given, but trust me, it's perfectly sufficient to finish the test. I completed the Midterm & Final within 20 mins, and I still got 10 mins to go through each question before submitted it. No hard calculation, just concepts/ideas and shrubberies. If you could not answer it within seconds, I highly doubt that you could get the right answer out with more time given.\n\nOverall, if you 1) are interested in learning financial strategies, or 2) want to apply the ML approach you acquired to investing, or 3) need a intro-class before taking Machine Learning, I highly recommend this course.",

The only thing difficult about this course, speaking only from my perspective, is that a couple of the projects took me a substantial amount of time not because of the security related topic but because to complete the assignment it required knowledge of the project environment that I had absolutely no experience with; e.g., in the last project dealing with web vulnerabilities you have to work with Javascript, which was completely foreign to me, so I took more time learning about Javascript than figuring out the vulnerability.  Outside of the projects, I averaged 2 hours a week on this course to cover lectures, textbook, quizzes and exams.  But factoring in the time I took on the projects which soaked up a lot of time, it bumps my average way up.  They give you about 4 weeks for every project, so if you are not a procrastinator like me you should be good.",

            "text": "This class is no joke. I had to rearrange my life to have enough time for assignments. You actually program the AI projects that you learn about in lectures. Note that my Python (and especially numpy) skills are at best average, although my statistics skills are good. Fellow students were very helpful on Piazza. Don't forget about Slack, too.\n\nAssignments: Some of the assignments require really strong math skills, most require a decent understanding of probability theory, and all require good Python scripting skills, including numpy.  There were 6 assignments in the Fall 2017 class; you get to drop the lowest grade. The assignments are auto-graded and you get multiple (from 5 to unlimited) attempts to submit the assignment and you know your grade for that assignment immediately. I really liked that. \nExams: take-home exams that take 10-20 hours to work through. Exams actually promote learning the material that wasn't part of the homework, so I liked that about them. Make sure to ask instructors any and all questions you might have. Don't try to get what the question is getting at, or you'll lose all the points for the question. \nGrading: The class is graded on a curve (median and above is A, one stdev below median is a B) but note that the median for most assignments was 100% (midterm and final were much lower, around 75%). For the online section, A ended up being about 87%, and a B was about 74% . Don't bypass extra credit questions if you have the time to complete them (some are very time consuming and others aren't). As the class progresses, you might not be able to complete an assignment, so extra credit on an assignment might be the difference between A and B, or even passing and failing. \n\nOverall, this was a great class, one of my favorites in the program, along with KBAI. If you actually have the prerequisites outlined, you'll spend much less time on it than I have and probably enjoy it. ",

This class gave an introduction to Machine Learning topics as well as stocking market concepts and in a final project, allowed you to create a market trading strategy that was powered by one of several algorithms you learned in class.  The course used Python and was light in a coding from my perspective as a software developer.  If you were not a coder, getting up to speed with Python and Numpy will take a fair amount of time.  Thankfully, as is becoming a trend in OMSCS courses, most of the assignments have grading scripts so you know the majority of your grade by the time you submit your assignment.  There is the caveat that reports require manual effort to be graded and occasionally, there are additional test cases the TAs use that are not included with the grading scripts but still fit within the specifications of the project.\n\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable class that was fairly graded.  There were two exams that were worth 12.5% of your grade each that were 30 questions in 30 minutes.  As you'd expect with that format, you must be a quick reader and thinker but ultimately know the concepts very well to do well on the exam.  For those that overanalyze or how to think through each exam questions, you will struggle on this kind of an exam and while the exams are not worth a large portion of your grade, you do need to perform decently to get an A in the class.\n\nAs with most classes you enjoy, the Professor makes the class what it is as the instructor lectures on Udacity are extremely engaging and entertaining while also being brief and informative.

Classes were organized in proper way along with active discussion among your peers. Initially everyone was suppose to do same project but later on students provide an option to work on other project based on their performance in first project. With this class there is lot of writing which consume a lot of time but there is an opportunity to get your writing published if it is unique and innovative. Though there are many concepts taught in the class about AI, but it was very hard to implement the same in practical life. To start with your program its a good course and one can easily learn python which is highly recommended to finish your project, Good Luck!!!",

Worked as an electrical engineer in power distribution between now and then. Full-time online student currently. No formal software analysis and test training in academic or work environment. This was one of two courses that I took in my first semester. \n\nCourse Experience: Overall, the course was worthwhile from my personal background. The instructors and TAs are truly excellent in operating the course and helping the students understand the material. The assignments are very effective in teaching concepts and new tools. All horror assignments alluded to in previous semesters have been removed. Some tools were specific to academic research and not necessarily widely used in industry, which may not be beneficial for some students. Everyone had to fight through the difficulty of obscure environments and languages. I had an abnormally large and painful learning curve for most assignments due to my deficient background, hence the 25 hours a week. Five different languages used throughout assignments, but I was able to figure out the appropriate usage of each given enough time. Once you endure through the learning curve, you realize the simplicity of the coding for all but one assignment that required a specific algorithm that I hadn't implemented before. The concepts and analyses are relevant as well. The exams require application of the knowledge rather than simple memorization. For example, given this type of analysis, find the output of the given simple code rather than recite the definition and characteristics of an analysis. I gave a \"liked\" rating as the lessons I learned on the assignments and exams were truly valuable but often cost me 20% or more on my grade, which can be a difference in a letter grade. Then again, one should have to earn an A. ",

You will use the basics of python for the assignments that are not exceedingly difficult. I simply had to transfer basic coding techniques from C and Java into Python syntax. This class introduces a broad and limited understanding of computer networks topics. This is not a course that will teach you about writing code for significant network applications with SDNs or otherwise. The instructor was largely absent which made for some easy extra credit discussions. The TAs were very helpful and effective and made the course successful. Only one assignment out of eight had a significant issue that didn't effect grades for anyone. Exams were simple memorization of concepts from the lectures and papers. I earned an A in this course even without the extra credit so I'm confident the vast majority of students would be able to given enough time to figure out the harder projects. Great first course or easier course to pair with a harder one. ",

The professor (Konte) was around for a couple of Piazza posts, answered a few questions about the exams, did two very awkward office hours, and that was about it. The head TA, Stacia, ran this course like a tight ship and really made it worthwhile. The other TAs were helpful and responsive as well. Communication was frequent and regular.  I found the content itself interesting, having familiarity only with the basics of TCP and a high-level understanding of internet architecture. I think I would have been fine without any prior knowledge of computer networks. The first few projects are designed like coding challenges in Python. They were challenging and I really enjoyed them, but they seemed to be a headache for people not familiar with Python or OO programming who took to Piazza to vent regularly.  The later projects were less time intensive and more about performing a set of trivial tasks and then analyzing the results against what was presented in the class. Some people got lost in the trees on these, more Piazza venting. I think I was lucky this semester in that there were a few very helpful and responsive students in the class who offered guidance on a lot of the class topics by their ability to summarize and explain the material on Piazza.

Though it requires a good amount of work to be done for projects and assigned readings. In fact I am glad I did not pair it with any other course.\n\nThe course covers the OS principles, its history and its relevance today. It’s pretty interesting to know how latest technologies of virtualization and cloud have its basis on principles from the 80s and 90s. The videos explain the topics well and have assigned papers for further readings. I must have only managed ~30-40% of those (some 40+ papers are provided at the start of the course.) The midterm and final questions are not MCQs and require some memorization as answers are to be given in bullet points/essay form. However the previous year papers and solutions are quite helpful in understanding the pattern. From lectures and previous year papers one tends to figure out which research papers are more important from exam point of view, though others are equally important from a learning perspective. Midterm and finals are 42% of the total grade. Grades are based on a curve. \n\nThere are 4 projects to be done and they require good C/C++ skills (C for projects 1, 2 and C++11 for projects 3, 4). Even with knowing C++ for last 9 years, the projects were not easy. Project1 was quite difficult, with many test cases to cover and Project4 required writing a lot of boilerplate code(~40 hrs of work, 1000+ lines of code). However all the projects were interesting and offered something new to learn.\n\nProf. Kishore is a great instructor who teaches very passionately and the lectures explain the topics very well. Office hours happen once every week. I could not attend any live but videos are recorded and shared for later viewing. The TAs are also pretty responsive and helpful, I was pretty surprised that they accepted my request to reassess my midterm solution.\n\nOverall it’s a great course with lots to learn (you would not be writing your own OS here if that's what you are expecting but you will learn a lot about OS principles, virtualization, distributed systems etc.)\nAdvise to anyone who is interested in taking this course - be prepared to work hard, DONOT start the projects late, brush-up on C/C++ skills if you are not using it on daily basis, it would not be easy learning it on the go. And try to follow the schedule provided for watching videos, I missed the schedule after the midterm exam as I was employed more than full-time at work and I had to slog a lot towards the end.\n",

The advantage is that you can easily understand the concepts, but the disadvantage is also obvious that you don't understand where these concepts come from and you have no idea how to practice them when facing a complex problem. The homework are pretty easy and solutions are given to you so they give you a very good opportunity to practice your programming skills in python. Although you can get free 30% from the homework assignments, the projects are not so easy.  Project 2 and Project 3 each took me more than 600 lines of code. They are not easy, but not that hard. As others said, even if you cannot solve the problem with the concepts from the lectures, you can solve them using geometrically solutions. So, overall, how much you learn from the course is based on how much extra work you paid to this course. One bad side of this course is that you either receive 100% or 0% for project or homework, so a lot of students will receive above 95% for the overall score. So the cutoff for A will be most likely 90%.",

This is a great introductory class for R / data visuals, but not a great one to start learning ML. I really appreciate Dr.Joyner's effort to keep the course organized, especially by releasing assignments in advance so that I could better manage my time (among other priorities). However, this course doesn't take much time at all. The only time consuming part will be the two projects (and only if you want to get in-depth). Final exam is on an easy-medium difficulty (definitely a lot easier than ML midterm).",

The research papers are also very dry. There are 8 projects and 3 exams. You do all the projects and you are guaranteed A with minimum effort putting in studying for exams. Python programming is very limited. Most are the projects are less than 20 lines of codes, or just changing some variables/configuration in the given codes. \nTA in this course is nothing but great. Projects are returned in timely manners. Head TA is very active on Piazza and there is weekly office hour in helping students on projects.  \nProject 2 and 3 can be tricky, but after that, the course has a very light workload. Piazza is a mess with some students abusing it with silly basic questions. People basically don't read and ask all kinds of questions that are clearly explained in the project requirement.\n",

The TAs are basically grading that you followed the guidelines more so then actually pass/fail the projects.\n\nThe lecture material was good a lot of subjects that were covered was not covered in my undergrad OS class. They were very well organized. Sometimes I feel as the quiz math is a little hand wavy but I think that's more of the approach on watching the lectures then the quality of the lectures.\n\nThe projects itself can be difficult. There are about about a month in between projects, Slack/Piazza are very helpful even if the TAs are not around. As everyone says start on the projects early, I program only in C at work, and it's also this flavor of programming style and I had some issues, I can see how other students can spend lots of time on the projects.\n\nThe exams are very hard, and in our semester there has been some mishaps with the questions, and even some answer choices.\n\nOverall though the class is great and is very well curved.

I recommend the same way if you don't want to be upset at the last moment...\n\nExams were not so easy, you should expect they are more complicated than sample problems. However they kindly offer a check list you should review before each exam, so by checking all of them, going through all quiz on lectures and sample problems, I think you can be ready for tests.\n\nAnd if you want A, you should definitely try to get all extra credits. This class offers a lot of extra points. I'd recommend visit the Slack channel if you get stuck on projects. TAs are more responsive on Slack.",

You will have 3 assignment write-ups, 3 project reflections and 2 exam essays. Each assignment will have 3 peer feedback so 24 peer feedback in total. That is a lot of writings but dont get me wrong, you will learn much of the concept through all of these. \n\nLectures are good and well prepared but mostly only concepts. You need to take extra steps to convert it into working code. I chose RPM project since it had more guidance and stable grading criteria. But if the chatbot assignment is improved in the future, YOU SHOULD TAKE IT! It is more valuable, used in the industry, and looks impressive in your portfolio (compared to RPM solver..). Piazza and Slack were active and really helpful.\n\nOverall a good survey course to KBAI concepts but expect to spend 20-30 hours a week for the assignments.",

There are some recorded on-campus lectures that explained the assignment in details. The assignment was easy since you can test your code in the remote machine so if you ace it, it means full score. Exam and mid-term were okay, you can review 1-2 days before taking it. The reddit experiment was not working and I hope they stick to piazza in the future. \n",

I did find any value from AI or ML perspective in this course. TA's are okay, sometimes their responses are vague, sometimes okay. They like lots of writing on out of the world scenarios.

The lecture content is somewhat dense at times but Ada does a great job of explaining concepts and I found her lectures extremely useful. There are two exams that are certainly tough but you only need to study the lecture material to do well on them. I'd recommend reading the assigned papers but the main concepts from them are also covered in lecture and I didn't bother to re-read them while studying for exams. This approach netted me above average scores on both exams which largely contributed to my A in the class.\n\nThere are three projects whose difficulty will depend on your familiarity with C. I came into the class with no C experience and definitely had my struggles on the first project, but I managed to power through it and felt far more comfortable for the rest of the class. Despite this I'd caution against taking this class with little/no C experience unless you consider yourself a strong programmer, otherwise you may be in for a rough ride. The first two projects are both difficult and time consuming and I would start them as early as possible because you are going to run into issues with C/Bonnie/etc along the way. If you manage to get through those you'll find that the last project takes significantly less time. The good news is that you have access to the autograder (Bonnie) for all projects so you generally know what grade you're going to get when you turn the project in. I put significant effort into the projects and got full points on all three, though I know students got docked minor points for poor READMEs and other small things.\n\nYes this class is hard and you're going to get frustrated during the projects, but your efforts will be rewarded by a solid foundation in operating systems and you will no longer fear C.",

The online format of the course is very succinct therefore additional readings definitely help in building the intuition. To do so, I have relied on various books, sites and blogs, but also used the discussion forums which are definitely a key to success for this course. This course is greatly designed and the knowledge acquired after finishing this course is definitely its strength. \n- Logistics-wise, on average one homework per week is to be submitted, the difficulty varies based on the content of the course, I have spend 8 to 10 hours a week between the course and the homework. The peer-grading can be frustrating at times, but equally rewarding when receiving a feedback on the submitted homework, which is not necessary the case. The weight of the homework in the overall grade is quite low compared to the level of effort. However, the time spent on the homeworks is useful to prepare for the midterms and the exams, which are more concept-based and of average difficulty.\n- Prerequisites-wise, elementary knowledge of R is definitely helpful to focus on the concepts rather than wasting time learning the language in parallel. Dedicated office hours will also help with R if required. Basic knowledge of math is required but the course is not deep diving into complex math formulas and theorems, which made it easy from that perspective.\n- Course team-wise, the course is provided in the perfect format, appropriate for online learning but still ensuring the quality of traditional academics. Real-life or project examples are shared by Dr Sokol with a pinch of humor throughout the course, which makes it very captivating and interesting as well, beyond the theory. Last but not least, the TAs are VERY present and supportive, which contributed a lot to the success of the cohort.",

            "text": "I took this as my very first OMSCS course by itself, and it was the perfect choice for that.\n\nOne of the TAs described this course as \"a whirlwind tour through Computer Vision\", and I think that is a very good synopsis. It focuses on \"classic\" (pre-deep learning) computer vision, though there is a final project option that uses KNNs. The lectures are countless (after I completed the first one, I thought I was done for the week, but then I looked at the syllabus and realized it was only one out of five for the first week) and dense, so you get a thorough understanding how each presented method works. Not much fluff or handwaving going on here, Prof. Bobick will explain the algorithms and the math involved in detail.\n\nThe problem sets are challenging and time consuming, but also well-designed and motivating. At the end of each of them you'll have something quite impressive to show to your friends or co-workers. About half the problem set points are awarded by the autograder, and the other half comes from the report which mostly consists of images and/or video generated by your code. So if you get all the points from the autograder, you're almost guaranteed to get an A. So the outcome of the course is quite binary: either you don't \"get\" the material or your coding skills are insufficient and you drop half-way through, or you're able to complete the problem sets and get an A or B (the exam being the wildcard). Speaking of the exam, it was open-everything and unproctored, but still quite challenging. The assignments are only released one at a time, so front-loading is not really possible. On the plus side, everyone is working on the same stuff, so the collaboration (on Piazza) is better.\n\nIn terms of pre-reqs, make sure to brush up on Linear Algebra (you should at least know what a system of linear equations is, for example). A little bit of Computer Graphics knowledge is also helpful, but not required. I did Pryby's \"Linear Algebra Refresher\" on Udacity in advance, which taught me Python and Linear Algebra at the same time (without numpy, which I picked up during the course).\n\nIf you have a full-time job, I would definitely recommend not taking a second course with this one (unless maybe if you're a numpy master who does singular value decomposition in his head for fun).",

The ideas make sense, it's just putting them together that takes a while.  Also, having had no prior exposure to Bayesian statistics really hurt me.  If at all possible, I'd recommend you study that topic up pretty good before taking since it represents a major cornerstone of the course (and it isn't immediately intuitive).\nJust for those who don't know the difference between AI and Machine Learning (that was me!), Artificial Intelligence is not making computers that think for themselves.  It is much more focused on finding clever hacks to make a computer work faster and more efficiently to arrive at a difficult (to compute, but obvious to humans) answer.  I later realized what I wanted was more under the umbrella of machine learning or reinforcement learning, but alas!  It was still a good class even though it wasn't exactly what I wanted.",

I have to really highlight that NO instructions were provided.  For example in one of the projects we were required to utilize a well known security tool and you were graded on your implementation of that tool, but no instructions or examples were given and that left some students wondering why they didn't just invest the money in taking a class to learn that toolset from another provider.\n\nIn my case I had to drop because of the time commitments (I work 40+ hours and run a business on the side) and because after getting As on other projects and assignments I received a terrible score on one project and could not recover.  Unfortunately, although I had put in 60 hours of work in and I could demonstrate the logic in my code was correct and met stated requirements, the TAs provided no credit on account of how they expected it to function (requirements that were unstated and undocumented).  Truthfully I received so little feedback and so few instructions that I withdrew in part because I realized I would learn more with my time and money spent elsewhere (ex: CCNA).\n\nAlmost considered dropping the program altogether (I felt the University misrepresented the coursework as something you could maintain with a full time job) but I decided to try another class and see how it goes.  I am also considering leaving work for a couple of months and may attempt the class again during that time.\n",

Submitting a regrade request led to more points being taken off a different question.\n\nThese TAs seem incapable of understanding ambiguity.  Depending on how you ask for clarification, you will get conflicting answers.  I tried reducing all piazza posts to yes/no questions, and even then they answered 'yes' to 'can I use string concatenation' and then marked points off for using string concatenation.  Stuff like that, all the time.  If you don't give the exact answer they expect, regardless of whether you met all the requirements or not, you fail.  They are very strict and do not appear to read your explanations.  I think they suffer from TL,DR syndrome.  Considering most of the questions are about invented, imaginary grammar, it's impossible to prove your point to them.\n\nSame thing for projects, with the added complication of partners who went through the same confusion, asked the same questions, and got different answers because they asked a different way.  The lectures are about generic parsers, and are unrelated to any actual work, which made things worse.  Try convincing your teammates that both the TA and the lectures are wrong.  Not gonna happen.  So you stop pushing commits to Git, because they keep changing your code, you end up doing all the work yourself, are accused of not being a team player, and then as time runs out they end up using your code in the end because you knew what you were talking about.  This actually happened to me.\n\nIf you don't care about your grade, and can handle nonsensical feedback/scores, you will learn some practical stuff.  Otherwise this course will make you question your sanity.",

            "text": "The overall presentation of this course left much to be desired. The professors could have been replaced with books and supplementary powerpoints and the course would have been more effective. Instead, we have topics consisting of a string of 20-minute videos of powerpoint readers that, on average, contained the efficacy of prescription-strength Ambien on a warm summer day. Few, if any, of the topics had anything really to do with Analytics as we can expect to use it in real life, and caused students to wonder who was paid off to make the class required. Towards the end of the class I found myself both 1) not learning anything and 2) just trying to score enough points to finish the class...which brings me to grading. \n\nOn grading, there were questions present on homeworks and exams that could have been based on information that wasn't in the printed notes, but touched on during lecture for about five seconds. When lectured on in detail, some of the presentation methods could be construed to be contradictory (or flat-out wrong in a couple of cases) and required confirmation in the human-led sessions. When it came time for the exam (or sometimes even the homeworks), god forbid if your flashcards or whatever memorization method failed you in that time period you immediately lost 1-4% from your final grade. \n\nOne could argue that every part of the class design achieved the needs and objectives, and full disclosure the final score was a mid-B. But looking back, I've completely forgotten some 80% of the course material and paid some good money only to have for three credit hours and traumatic memories to show for it. If Dr. Jayaraman's argument of a happy customers being the most important part of a business's survival holds true, this class needs a complete overhaul to deliver a more positive, conducive learning experience.",

Weeks without projects were pretty tame, but projects could be fairly time-intensive.\n- Success on projects was highly non-linear.  For most of them, your solution either worked or it didn't.  Points were awarded for individual test cases that were all fairly similar.  The instructor-provided test harness provided examples, so you weren't totally in the dark, but testing wasn't done in a cumulative fashion where each successive piece of code was built on a previously tested piece.  You've got to construct your own tests and debugging process, but hey, that's life.\n- The lecture content and especially the projects are deep-dives into filtering and path planning.  This is core stuff, but doesn't include the breadth of concepts involved in automated cars, much less robotics generally.  There was no machine vision or reinforcement learning content.\n\nOther Notes:\n- 100% Python\n- No group project, voluntary or otherwise, unlike some previous semesters\n- Taking 6601: Artificial Intelligence beforehand isn't required, but probably helpful\n\nMy grade: A",

I have never been interested in anything remotely related to finance, so I was slightly concerned about whether or not I would enjoy this course. Professor Balch does a great job explaining the finance content without assuming any prior knowledge about trading. I've actually had conversations with coworkers about day trading thanks to what I learned in this course. It is practical!\n\nI found the projects to be enjoyable throughout the semester. They do a good job of building upon each other as the semester progresses, and they're balanced appropriately. The two most difficult (time consuming) projects were spread throughout the semester. The midterm was fair and shouldn't be too challenging to anyone that stays on top of the course content throughout the semester. \n\n**Major pro**: all assignments for the semester were released in draft at the start of the course. This allowed you to work ahead if you knew you had scheduling challenges coming up during the semester. \n\n**Biggest con**: Although the projects built upon one another, we often had to copy and paste code from one file into another. I would have liked the different files/classes to interact with one another a little better. That being said, though, that's a pretty minor con. \n\nThe coursework was never insanely difficult, but it did a great job providing an intro to some ML and RL concepts. I'd gladly take this course again and certainly recommend it!",

            "text": "This class is probably a good first class or one to save to take with another class.  No tests, and most of the work towards the end.  I wrote 5 hours/week here but I am not sure how much it actually was, since I basically just completed every assignment the weekend (day) before it was due.  The group project was the only thing that required scheduling, but if you have a good group like I did then it's not a problem; plus it was an obscenely small % of the total grade.  The periodic assignments, class participation, and peer feedback was a large percentage, and they were very manageable.\n\nThis class went through the motions hitting all the key beats, but focusing mostly on UML class diagrams and state charts.  It then touched on and required us to generate behavior diagrams and a deployment diagram.  There were periodic assignments requiring various diagrams to be generated for various designs, and then there was a group project.  The group project was based on a scenario described in a prior assignment, so the initial work consisted of reviewing the group members' class diagrams and code and combining all the best parts (or picking someone's who got a good grade).  All of that was fine.\n\nThen there was a surprisingly large amount of coding.  It was my first time having to write Java in 10 years or so, and I was surprised, considering design can 100% be done without writing code.  Either way, as you can see from my rating, it was pretty easy overall, but I would just be warned that there is significant coding required.  Also the videos were weird; I didn't think they were bad at the time, but having taken a couple more classes since I can see they weren't great.  Also, they didn't always have anything to do with what we were actually generating for the assignments and the project, but the state chart ones were OK.",

Definitely read the textbook as there is material covered on the exam that isn't presented in lectures, only the textbook.\n\nI took this course in combination with Intro to OS.

Also the assignments often don't get finalized until within a week of the due date. This created a lot of noise on Piazza in the beginning of the semester, but after a few assignments students realized that the assignments probably won't change much between draft mode and finalization so it's okay to work off of the draft version. Just be aware that the <a href=\"http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Spring_2018#Assignments_.26_Grading\">assignment descriptions</a> are verbose so it is easy to miss a detail.

The lectures were very understandable (too understandable) but kind of long (for the content), the book is just ok - often a savior though, the quizzes sometimes are unexplainably difficult considering the lectures they are attached to, and the assignments are just something else. \n\nIn very short, my main complaint is the amount of material crammed into this course. This course could have easily been broken into at least 2 parts, one probabilistic (Bayes nets, decision trees, others) and one deterministic (A*, constraint programming, adversarial search etc). Unfortunately, with everything thrown in, some stuff will suffer (and is unfortunate, most of the stuff is worth studying more carefully). \n\nA second complaint would be about the lectures. I had a hard time taking them seriously, most of the time prof. Starner and assistants try to paint a relaxed and jokey/fun atmosphere, in some sort of popularity contest style. Laudable try, but unfortunately it made the lectures lack the rigor they needed, which proved a problem for assignments. It was impossible (IMO) to approach any assignment with the lectures only, which presented a problem in itself - if one puts 3-4h/week in lectures, just to have to read another 3h from the AI book, that makes the lectures kind of useless. And one needs all the time possible for assignments. \n\nDon't want to insist too much, but various other things added to frustration: fighting Bonnie (with its arcane errors) for assignments, fighting with TAs about solutions for mid/end term exams, the grading on the curve (\"is it enough a 90% to get an A, when most assignments have 100% as median???\"), opening the course with \"adversarial search\" instead of with actual \"search algos\", and many other small issues. \n\nMaybe I'm too biased already, I would recommend people buy the AI book and study it at their own pace. A lot cheaper and a lot less frustrating. ",

The lectures are simply a mish mash of materials. Just a bunch of concepts thrown in.\n3. The TAs are not very active. The ones that are provide confusing and sometimes contradictory answers. \n4. The project writeups are mostly poorly written, requiring lots of clarifications from TAs. Almost all projects (except the first) had lots of clarifications, some coming as late as  a couple of days before submission. So if you are the early bird types, forget about submitting early.\n5. There is no autograder you have access to - no way for you to know if you've made a silly mistake in your project. Given that it's binary grading (you either get all points for a section or lose it all), you simply are out of luck if you made a silly mistake. Especially if you made that mistake early on, you basically get a 0. \n\nMy advice is to stay away from this course. I feel like I wasted an entire term and learned very little. ",

            "text": "This was a fantastic first course for me. I am an experienced software engineer with a few years of experience without a CS undergrad degree. OS concepts was something I wanted to learn out of OMSCS. This course provided a nice introduction to these concepts, at least to a point where I know where to look for for more information. It is not as detailed as a standard OS course at a top-tier school, though. For example, in my undergrad school, I know that CS majors had to actually write an OS from scratch as the project for this course. This course only requires us to use some of the OS features to implement some applications. This course covers a breadth of information in an easily ingestible way. But it does not go deep into any of the concepts.\n\nBasic knowledge of programming is absolutely necessary. If pointer, references and SIGSEGVs scare you, this course is probably not for you. You don't need to be an expert in C, but you need to be comfortable developing small applications, and with basic debugging. Nothing you can't learn in ~1 week if you already know Java or another equivalent language.\n\nThe instructor, Ada, was fantastic. The lectures were very well made. Ada was available in Piazza to help out fellow students. The exams were great, the TAs were always prompt. All in al, a very well-organized course. I feel spoiled for future courses! :)\nHighly recommended!",

            "text": "This is my 2nd class in the program and I really enjoyed it overall. Although I took it in a full semester, I think this would be better as a summer course because there were about 4 \"down\" weeks in the course where I didn't do anything. \n\nThe projects span a wide range of topics, but are very manageable. I thought the 1st project, Buffer Overflow was the hardest if you don't have background in C and memory architecture. The 2nd, Malware Analysis, was very straightforward. The Cryptography project was also fairly easy since you don't have to write your own mathematical algorithms unless you really want to. (So you can make it more challenging if you desire by not using libraries.) Finally, 4th Web Security project definitely seemed very hard for those who had never done any web development. If you have encountered JS/HTML/PHP, it is fine. \n\nThe Canvas quizzes are worth 20% of your grade and open book. So basically, 20% of your grade should be 100% right off the bat. The exams were a bit more random/tricky with some material included that is barely even covered in 2 sentences in the book. I read most of the book, but overall I probably won't retain much since the book is dry and topics are quickly covered. I somewhat regret spending time reading since I don't feel I walked away from the reading with a really deep understanding, but rather with a surface level acquaintance with terminology to pass an exam. I'm sure I will forget all the specialized terminology within a few weeks, hopefully the general concepts stick though. \n\nOverall, it was a fun course.  ",

            "text": "This course is effectively two, so must be reviewed in two parts:\n\n* Part one is taught by Dr. Eric Feron, who is a GT professor. This is the far better of the two course parts. The homework assignments and projects are well-defined and fairly straightforward, if divorced from the content of the lecture videos.\n\n I honestly did not even watch the course videos for the most part, and found them tangential at best to the tasks you're asked to complete. The actual videos are produced well enough but lack any kind of context or narrative thread, so it's very easy to just let it go in one ear and out the other without retaining anything. The Udacity course also commits an imho cardinal sin by embedding multiple videos on a single lesson section and consequently disabling auto-play (which goes back to the aforementioned lack of narrative thread). Ultimately though, as I noted before, this isn't a huge deal because the lecture videos aren't particularly useful -- in fact, the few instances when I did try to reference them to clarify something in an assignment I couldn't find anything pertinent.\n \n The homework assignments varied quite a bit, starting with basically some short Q&A/essays on cyber-physical systems, then going into basically a homework assignment solving a physics 101 problem (calc-based physics 101, to be clear), and then some minor coding assignments in C around black-box testing and input-output feedback loops. The essays required a day or so of work to compile, but neither the physics quiz nor the coding assignments required more than a couple hours work.\n\n Both projects involve commanding either one or a set of [GRITSbots](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/2014/11/the-gritsbot/) to accomplish a set of specified tasks, subject to a set of specified constraints, in a MATLAB [Robotarium](http://robotarium.gatech.edu/) simulator. You also have the opportunity to run your code against live robots in the Robotarium for the first project, which is neat but also frustrating, because you're only allotted two attempts in the actual live environment, and will likely find that your robot does not behave live as advertised in the simulation. This is not an issue for grading though, as you are provided a data set to use if needed for the analysis portion of this project, and are graded for code based on the results of the sim and not the live result.\n\n Both projects should be completable with a dedicated weekend of work.\n\n If the _entire_ course was just Dr. Feron's course, I would've probably rated this class \"Neutral\" with an \"Easy\" difficulty. I don't feel like I really _gained_ much from it, but the assignments were for the most part entertaining and it's elective hours.\n\n* Part two is taught by Dr. Jérôme Hugues, who is effectively \"on-loan\" from the Institute for Space and Aeronautics Engineering, part of the Université Fédérale de Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées. He is highly credentialed and active in the CPS field. But don't for a second be fooled into thinking that implies he's effective as an instructor in this course.\n\n As Dr. Hugues is French, there is a language barrier to be overcome for the predominantly Anglophone demographic of the OMSCS program. His lessons and assignments are of course delivered in English -- you don't need to learn French, of course -- but his spoken English _is_ heavily accented and difficult to understand, and his written assignments often lack precision.\n\n Whereas the assignments for Dr. Feron's portion of the course were well-defined and had explicit questions and/or objectives, Dr. Hugues' assignments were exclusively _extraordinarily_ vague and open-ended questions, as though he's attempting a Socratic descent into teaching the material. That works _great_ in an open classroom setting where students and mentor can collaborate on exploring the topic. It is not at all appropriate for a graded assignment for which you're only allowed one submission.\n\n As another review noted -- and I don't know if this is just a cultural misunderstanding or actual personality -- Dr. Hugues can also be quite brusque when you attempt to ask for clarification. He often declines to answer questions outright, asserting that it's deliberately vague so that you can decide how best to answer (but how can I answer when I don't understand the query?).\n\n It could just be that I am not a smart individual, and certainly some students in the class were able to complete his assignments, but for both of them I found myself completely lost and in the mindset of \"I understand the individual words you've used, but I can't put them together into coherent entities that make sense in my brain.\" I've spent days trying to dissect his project and still don't understand what it is I'm intended to do. I suspect that, given Dr. Hugues' background, he just assumes a _lot_ of systems engineering background as common-sensible, which is probably a valid assumption at his home institution with his home target audience, but _isn't_ valid in a computer science course that has, at best, only an informal prerequisite of anything of the sort. I sure as hell don't, and I'm suffering mightily from it.\n\n It is worth noting that Dr. Hugues' portion of the course does not begin until _after_ the drop date, so Dr. Feron's portion can easily lull you into a sense of false security about where you stand grade-wise. With a _perfect_ score in the course going into drop day, I'm now basically assuming zero credit on all of Dr. Hugues' assignments and hoping I can perform well enough on the final (I think I can, since it is, I believe, prepared by Dr. Feron) to maintain a C.\n\n Consequently, for Dr. Hugues' portion of the course I would rate \"Strongly Disliked\" and \"Very Hard\" in terms of difficulty: I have learned nothing and gained nothing but frustration from it. I _do_ think that if you were able to surmount the language barrier, expand this to a full course on its own merit, and assume less in terms of prerequisite knowledge, this _could_ be an effective course. But absolutely not as it currently stands.\n\ntl; dr: Take this class at your peril. If you have an EE or systems engineering background you're probably going to be fine. If you don't, or have never worked on cyber-physical systems before, this is probably not an appropriate first course. (No, [6263](https://omscentral.com/courses/CS-6263) is not ample preparation.)",

            "text": "<b>EDIT 2:</b> Project 4 grade received on May 4 in the late morning and apparently I was not suspected of cheating.  A simple update on Piazza could have saved me, and probably many others, a lot of stress.  I still stand by everything else I said below in the original review and edit 1.\n\n<b>EDIT 1:</b> As of May 4, I have to downgrade my review from \"liked\" to \"neutral\" due to some stressful communication issues.  We were told on May 1 that all project 4 grades were expected to be returned later that night.  Also on the night of May 1, we were told that the instruction team found out some students used past projects on GitHub to complete project 4.  After this, the instruction team basically fell silent with very little exception.  Like many others, I don't have my project 4 grade yet.  I didn't cheat on project 4 or at all in this course, so the fact that I have neither my grade nor even the smallest relevant update from the instruction team is getting very frustrating and making me anxious, especially since it's now been 2.5 days since we heard anything relevant.  I'm sure I'm not alone in this.  My mind is racing at the thought of all the ridiculous hoops I'll probably need to jump through to fight a wrongful cheating accusation, and it's causing a lot of unnecessary stress.  Take this course with caution.\n\n<b>Original review:</b><br/>\nThis was a great course and was not too demanding. There are 10 open-book quizzes, each worth 2% of the grade. Almost every question is verbatim from the textbook or lecture notes. There are two closed-book exams worth 10% each. They were on par with the quizzes in difficulty, maybe a little more so since notes weren't allowed and they covered more material. The final exam was not cumulative. There were four projects, each worth 15%. The projects were some of the most interesting and fun I've ever done in CS, as an undergrad or grad student. We had about a month to do each project, which is <b>way</b> more than necessary. For that reason, IIS is a fantastic course to pair with another course.\n\nProject 1 is all about buffer overflows. Knowing C helps a bit but is by no means a necessity. It's probably more important to know about internal memory architecture at a somewhat high level. This project was definitely the most time consuming for me, and I think I can objectively say it's the one with the most amount of work. (P4 might be more work if you have literally no web dev experience.)\n\nProject 2 is about malware analysis. I'm not that interested in malware but I still enjoyed working on this project. It was a massive decrease in difficulty and workload from project 1 also. No programming required for this project; it's all with a tool in a provided VM.\n\nProject 3 is about cryptography. This one was awesome. Some basic cryptographic algorithm programming in Python. Previous knowledge of Python will absolutely be helpful, and even if you don't there is plenty of time to learn it before the deadline. A ton of guidance is given and a lot of the code is already provided.\n\nProject 4 is about web security and exploiting XSRF and XSS vulnerabilities, and doing an SQL injection. This one was extremely easy if you have previous HTML and JavaScript experience. There is some PHP code in the files we're provided, so it helps to know that a bit. But if you have previous programming experience then understanding the PHP code will not be an issue. Also, the only code we actually had to write ourselves for this is HTML and JavaScript.\n\nReally cool stuff. The textbook is dry AF and probably the worst part of the course. The lectures were so-so but informative. Mostly absentee professor on Piazza, but seriously, who cares? We learn material from the professors' lecture videos, not from their Piazza posts.\n\nI definitely recommend taking this class. If you're lucky, your Piazza forum will be filled, like it was this semester, with highly entertaining posts from people constantly whining about the dumbest things, largely because they can't read/follow instructions or they need some serious hand-holding and spoon-feeding.\n",

            "text": "Love, love, love this class!  A very gentle and applied introduction to ML.  It also teaches you NumPy and pandas from scratch.  There is a lot of info about this course publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/.\n\nThere are 8 projects in the class, and for the most part they increase in difficulty as you go along.  The first two were almost nothing; they can barely be classified as projects.  But it makes sense because they're supposed to serve as introductions.  All of the projects were very interesting and fun to do.  I have no previous ML experience (except for some basic boosting/bagging from CV but that was hardly a decent exposure, as much as I enjoyed CV) and that didn't hurt me in this class at all.  It was so cool in the final project to program a trading system based on machine learning and look at the results.  Code is tested on real stock data from real companies with some made up companies thrown in every now and then.\n\nAll of the project info is available ahead of time (see the link above) with the caveat that everything is in \"draft mode\" at first and will be \"finalized\" later.  For some reason this was a huge problem for some people in the course.  They refused to start until the project was finalized, which is kind of stupid on their part.  We were told repeatedly not to do that and that any changes made would be minimal.  The biggest change that I remember is in the second project.  We had to optimize something different from the previous semester's students.  Aside from that I think one or two other projects had a minor change and all the others had literally no change.  People blew this draft mode thing way, way out of proportion.\n\nThere is a proctored midterm and a proctored final.  Both are closed everything.  The final is not cumulative.  The midterm was extremely easy and was almost a regurgitation of previous midterms.  It sounded like that won't always be the case.\n\n3 textbooks.  One is required and is co-written by the professor.  It's fairly cheap (especially for a textbook) and is a pretty good read.  You'll definitely want it for the midterm at least.  The other two books are Python for Finance by Hilpisch and the ML book by Mitchell.  I can't remember if those two were actually required, but I didn't find them completely necessary.  The lectures were enough.\n\nIt's often said that a finance background is helpful for this course.  I think what people mean is a trading background, not a finance one.  I have almost no finance background but I do have a relatively extensive trading background, and that helped a lot.  I think manual_strategy would be the most difficult for people with no trading background since it requires an understanding of technical analysis and indicators.  This stuff isn't too difficult, but it is a lot to learn on top of everything else if you're new to it.\n\nThat's kind of true of the course in general.  It's not that this material is difficult, it's just that there is sometimes a lot of work in a short timespan.  If you have a good background in Python or trading then it'll be less work, of course.\n\nThis is a good first class if you can get in your first semester.  Also, this course potentially pairs well with other courses, depending.  I paired it with IIS and had no problems.  If you have no Python background and no trading background then I don't recommend taking it over the summer.  But, I do recommend this course in general overall.",

            "text": "Basic course for ML itself but a good introduction to Python/Numpy if you have no experience with them as it is barely any work except for 2 of the projects.  I had zero experience with both Pandas and Numpy and still only spent 5-7 hours every week. I also enjoyed the finance theory aspect. It made me appreciate the finance side of things more than I thought I would have.\n\nThe course itself will teach you not a lot new if you know even a bit about ML. The Q Learning RL project is interesting but is dealt with at a basic high level. I wish we spent more time on reinforcement learning.\n\nThe trading part is basic for an ML course focused entirely on trading. Yes we build some technical indicators to trade on but don't expect to learn anything cutting edge for finance. No Deep Learning. No discussion on high speed algo trading strategies. I wish we were trading in a simulator in real time for our final project or at least had a Kaggle final project. That would have been cool.\n\nThis is a good course if you're looking to get your feet wet in ML/Python but if you already took AI, RL and ML then it can be redundant. I recommend taking this course early on in your OMSCS career before you venture out to the other ML classes as it will be good prep for some of the harder courses.",

I didn't know much in terms of Android development so going from the first individual Android assignment to the group project was a bit of a stretch. Someone else in my group was knowledgeable about Android which helped. You don't get to choose your group, but you can assign preferences for meetings times. Hint: choose to meet early in the week before project deadlines.\n\nIndividual project is implementing a command line utility. The focus is on testing and refactoring.  It's straightforward, and while the black-box testing assignment doesn't provide much in the way of learning, I did find the overall project helpful for thinking about test cases and inputs.\n\nGood course to kick off the OMSCS program and pair with a harder course.",

The first project requires GDB, which I'd never used before. If you're comfortable with debugging in any language, this should be no problem. Knowing JavaScript, HTML, DOM, and some basics about how the event model works in a browser is very helpful for the last project. The weekly quizzes actually help learn the material because you can take them over and over. I took them at the beginning of the week, then looked for the answers while reading the text and watching the lectures. Then you can get a 100% by taking it again at the end of the week. There are two proctortrack exams that follow the same true/false and multiple choice format of the quizzes. They are not difficult, but some of the questions are poorly/awkwardly worded in a way that was frustrating. Getting the text book is required as many questions for the quizzes and exams come from the text and are not explicitly covered in the lectures.",

Prior to this, I took 6220, 6290, and 8803-08 (HPC, HPCA, and Compilers) and found them all to be engaging and enjoyable. They were tough at times, but I felt it was time well spent. I learned a lot, and found the things I learned to be relevant and empowering. \n\n6250 was not of the same caliber by a large margin, and was very disappointing overall. If I had known then what I know now, there's no way I would have considered taking it.\n\n1) The content is poorly organized. There's little structure or hierarchy to the topics. It's a random smattering of things. \n2) The depth is shallow. The quizzes are inane.\n3) The assignments are either borderline trivial, or frustrating due to tricky technicalities.\n\nI don't fault the TA's or the instructor. I believe they are doing their best with what they were given. I think they have tried to make incremental improvements as time has gone on, but there really is no saving it. All the lectures and assignments should be thrown away and the course redesigned from scratch. ",

If you want a good way to learn R this is a good way to do that and learn some visualization things as well. Liked the projects a lot.

The material is basically a frankenstein of business undergrad core classes in managerial & financial accounting, marketing, finance, entrepreneurship and management. If you enjoy long, dry videos, powerpoints with clipart diagrams and a punishing method of grade distribution, this is the course for you.  \n\nWhile the material may be uninspiring, the course structure is something the instructors could easily fix. There are 6 opportunities to earn points throughout the entire semester, which leaves very little room for error. Additionally the exam questions are full of opaque wording and seemingly arbitrary distinctions. Some questions ask you to select all the potentially correct answers from a list many options with no credit for partially correct answers, a decision which is truly baffling to me. \n\nThe instructor is responsive on Piazza at least, however that doesn't make up for the fact that the course is bad. Take your vitamins and power through it if possible. Make sure you're on top of your game on the homeworks and especially the two tests since they account for 80% of your grade, or else you may get a second crack at it when retaking the course. ",

The projects are a great way to learn more about how things really work and I do highly recommend that you steal code for this class rather than writing it from scratch (yes this is allowed and encouraged for this class). It'll save you a lot of time and gives you more time to play around and write your actual analysis (which is basically the entire score for your projects).\n\nThe lectures are great for me at least, but I do know of a few people who did not like the banter between the two professors. The extra readings, while not necessary, I believe is a great supplement to the lectures. Do read them to expand your understanding but is not really needed for the tests.

In the end, I did not get much out of it. In addition, the course lectures include many interview videos which are often lengthy but do not provide much academic values to the topic.

Phase 3 is a huge amount of work, and the final test 2 weeks later is the hardest of the semester.  You'll spend hours upon hours on Phase 3 and that final exam.  The whole class is structured around designing and building a database-backed application (like many websites you might have used).  It is a lot of fun to work on Phase 3, since it's all about implementing something using MySQL+PHP, Python, etc that you've been designing all semester.  But the graders are rather tough about the first two phases having the diagrams and pseudocode being perfect, when in reality a lot of the pseudocode gets changed when actual implementation occurs (at least in my case).\n\nAll in all it's a good class, and the workload you have really depends on your group.  But it's more than you think, and I don't recommend taking a second class with this.

            "text": "This was my first class in the program and I absolutely loved it. Coming into this I was hoping for a solid introduction to OMSCS, computer science, and C and I would say that it was very successful on all fronts. I’ve consolidated my thoughts / tips about the class below based on topic.\n\n#### Projects\n1. The project code always contains a base set of functionality which you enhance. PR1 for example gives you most of the code for a working C program, you just need to cover the business logic (creation/parsing of a GETFILE protocol message). \n2. TA’s always provided the CMakelists file if you prefer to use CLion and that also makes things easier. \n3. _PR1 – GETFILE PROTOCOL_\n  1. I had very little C experience before this and I was a bit scared coming into the first project. Consequently, I began PR1 as soon as I could and finished about two weeks early. I spent a lot of time in the beginning establishing best practices for how to do things. It forced me to work slowly and do a ton of research on various C aspects, but by PR3-4 I was very confident in my C ability.  \n4. _PR2 – Extra credit research project_\n  2. I went above and beyond and did the experiments, which was not required. It took me about 4 hours to complete. \n5. _PR3 – Shared memory-based IPC_\n  1. This one was pretty easy for me. I completed it in about 6 hours total, including both parts.\n6. _PR4 – RPC_\n  1. This program is basically PR1 and PR3 where RPC abstracts all of the communication. It’s pretty easy, but took me about 12 hours to complete because I stumbed on the MT section. \n\n#### Knowing C\n1. I was completely new to C coming into this and excited to get some exposure. The first project will force you to use strings. Working with strings in C can be challenging. If you're like me and eager to learn new lower level languages, this class is perfect for you. \n2. The other thing that was pretty complicated was the implementation of a thread pool. You don't have to do it like this, but in terms of performance its the best way. Once you get a working thread pool implementation, you can use it for subsequent projects in the class. \n\n####  Tests\n1. Test 1 – 25% of your grade. I found it harder than the second exam. Median was a 76%.\n2. Test 2 – 30% of your grade. IMO, it was easier than the first exam by a long shot. \n\n####\tTAs\n1. Overall, the TAs were highly responsive, but very shame based. I suppose it’s an industry problem. The expectation is that you know the readme very well. Questions about well defined things on the readme or C related questions you can google will get you ridicule. Always try to find the answer on your own before you ask. \n\n####\tTips\n1. Use the study guide to study for the test. It seems obvious but, I studied everything I could get my hands on for the first test and felt like I made it much harder on myself. I found that other students were doing similar things. Since this is an introductory class, there are certain topics in which the rabbit hole goes deep. Make sure that you’re studying the material as it relates to GIOS. \n2. I would strongly recommend using CLion. They make an IDE for every language used in the OMSCS program and its heavily used in the industry. I ended up installing this on my Ubuntu VM and using it from there.\n3. There is a slack for this class and I would recommend it. The TA’s are very responsive. \n4. I would recommend the environment setup they use. I tried doing PR1 on my mac and had all sorts of problems. \n5. For debugging, there are a few tools which will make your life easier. I found these to be most helpful:\n  1. Telnet – must have for the first part to test your server before you finish the client\n  2. Wireshark – to confirm whether client or server is breaking\n  3. CLion debugger – self explanatory\n6. There is always a performance metric component to the test. These are based on the readings assigned during the semester. Know those very well, it’s low hanging fruit on the exam. \n7. Execution flows are a big part of this class. If you don't understand the math, I strongly recommend that you draw out the flow. The questions on the test are usually small enough that you can draw them out to achieve the answer. This is what I did for test 1 and 2 and it worked out well. \n8. At the end of the class, they added a lot of material and I felt like the amount of time required increased per week. Take this into account after the midterm and stay on-top of your lectures. \n9. \tSome of the last readings are unnecessary and very long. The RPC reading, for example, is unnecessary, dense, and 40 pages long. Since it was not present on the study guide, I skipped reading it altogether and it paid off. ",

Peer review many times is subjective and can't respond to reviews unless you have been graded pathetically in which scenario you have to go via TAs for re-evaluation. 3 peer reviews on each assignment. Some people are just mean in the review processing.\nYou will learn from other a lot during reviewing other's HWs.\n3 midterms are fair but tricky on wordings and make you overthink.  Questions are graded with high weight and a wrong answer can cost you equivalent to 4 HWs.\nMake sure you understand concepts and applications to get good marks in midterms.\nThe project is easy but again subjective nature of peer review is something can take out your points for no reason.\nRubrix for the project is not well defined. \nOverall contents of videos are good. Make your own notes and be active on Piazza and slack. \nTA's are doing a very good job and always got the answer to questions within few hours. Even Dr Sokol answers and guides when needed, which is really great.\n\nOverall great course, you learn a lot. \n\nI usually used to spend 30 min every day (give and take) in reading material for the week and spending on HW during weekdays and weekends more like 10(+) hours in self and deep study and homework.\nSome homework used to be longer and can take more hours, so in general demands on an avg 20 hrs each week.\n\n\n",

I would definitely not recommend following the approach that I did though by thinking I could pick up C on the fly; as far as I can tell, I spent *way* more time on the projects than most of my peers, and most of that time I was way out in left field anyway. If you're _still_ determined to take this course without knowing C first (hey I get it, I was stubborn too), then do yourself a favor and go pick up a copy of [The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/) (I found one pretty cheap at a local used books store) right now, because it'll be your lifesaver for the first few projects.\n\nThat said, even though I really struggled with the programming assignments, I still really enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot from it. The lectures are great: clear and easy to follow; the professor actually does office hours every week and goes over some great and useful stuff; the TAs are super helpful (and a pretty funny and entertaining bunch on Slack!); and all-in-all the course was very well organized. I am definitely going to miss this class!",

The class was very disorganized with many poorly communicated corrections and changes through the semester.  There is almost no teaching on the actual technology beyond basic concepts and logical architecture of FHIR.  The activities are rudimentary and don't provide much benefit other than following directions and using trial and error to get things working.  The essays focused more on references than content.\n\nThe workload week to week was very inconsistent.

There were assignments every few weeks, along with a midterm project and final project. There were also a few quizzes and a final test. You'll notice in a lot of the other reviews they mention the \"above and beyond\" aspect of a lot of assignments. The vast majority of assignments were \"above and beyond\", meaning that if you fulfilled all the requirements, the highest grade you could get was a 90%, and the rest of the 10% comes from going above and beyond the original requirements. Getting all of this 10% was pretty tricky. Some assignments, like the midterm and final projects, were not subject to this rule.\n\nBecause of the A&B rule, it was relatively straight forward to get a B in the class, but difficult to get an A.\n\nThe class is done mainly using Python and Numpy - would recommend getting familiar with those tools to have an easier time in the class",

            "text": "Overall: Great class - it's so applicable to the real world that I would frequently learn something in class and hear about it within my job within a couple weeks.  (I am a new member of a data science team).  Dr. Sokol structures the lectures well to be informative and efficient.  Bonus: dad jokes.\n\nHomework:  Challenging at first without R experience, but you quickly learn how to handle the language and to debug problems that pop up - plus, the TA hours and ability to work with peers helps tremendously.  I am a strong believer in Dr. Sokol's statement that we will continually need to learn new programming languages and packages in our career, and so being thrown into things without being hand-held is vaulable and realistic.\n\nProject - Fairly simple, though peer grading makes it a bit scary!  NOT a group project, which I appreciated.\n\nExams - While I received decent grades, I will say the exams were tricky (mostly #2 and #3).  Dr. Sokol knows how to write an exam to make sure you REALLY know the information more than surface-level.  Some questions are easy to interpret incorrectly, and that is my only gripe with the class.\n\nPrereqs - While there are technically prereqs for probability, linear algebra, calculus, and programming experience, the primary one that you need is some programming experience.  Coming in completely blind to programming would have been a significant handicap. Probability, linear algebra, and calculus are fairly minor (though not COMPLETELY invisible - eigenvectors and the calculation of linear, convex quadratic, general convex, and non-convex equations all do come up).\n\nOverall - definitely recommend this class, even as a standalone for non-degree students.

The class is a lot of work, but the TAs are very helpful through Piazza and Slack.  Exams are challenging, but doable with a generous curve.  Definitely study:  review the assigned readings and lectures.  Exams used ProctorTrack but were open notes/book/internet.  The instructor (Prof Vuduc) was great, but only showed up for a couple of the office hour sessions.  I would have liked more interaction with him.\n\nA few things that I disliked:  it felt like there was a lack of feedback on graded work.  For the projects/labs, many times implementing algorithms as presented in class would not get you 100% on the lab (but you could still get an A or B fairly easily).  You need to be creative or research some methods to speed up your code (grades are based on run times).  After the grades were returned, there wasn't really much discussion on ways that people were able to get full credit, so I felt there was an opportunity for more learning that was missed.\n\nSome of the later projects had a few issues with cluster being temperamental - no fault of the teaching staff, but definitely frustrating for the students.  Our grades were based solely on run times, but we couldn't actually get accurate timings on some of the labs.\n\nFinally, the exams are notoriously difficult.  Midterm was 60 points, but only graded out of 50, and the prof recognized that no one would even get close to 60 points during grading.  An additional (generous) curve was added after grading was complete.",

            "text": "This course has been an incredible source of stress, anxiety, and frustration. Though I expected the work to be difficult (my courses last semester in the OMSA program certainly were), it has bordered on impossible at several points given the unreasonably complicated nature of the work we are assigned.  I spent more time decoding confusing instructions and being my own IT support this semester than I did working on any visualization projects or concepts. I was very close to withdrawing from the class and if it weren’t for the group project and the fear of letting my teammates down, I probably would have dropped it.\n\nFor each homework set I spent at least the first week (40+ hours) just trying to get my computer set-up with the software/environments necessary to even start programming. In several instances this has required making changes to the firmware, multiple uninstalls and re-installs all of which are incredibly time-consuming and I think not the point of this course. My only computer is my work computer and I have felt quite nervous about how these changes I have made might impact my machine and my ability to do my job if it were to crash. \n\nTo complete a homework assignment students were required to join Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which required entering personal credit card information. For each of these services there was the potential of running up thousands of dollars in charges if a mistake was made. This is an entirely unacceptable risk to ask students to take. Often learning takes place when mistakes are made and to put a financial burden on students who are already paying to learn is wrong.\n\n\nAt several points throughout the semester direct messages to the instructors went unanswered for days. At one point a very urgent message (labeled as such in the subject line) was ignored for 84 hours. At the point it was answered it was too late.\n\nThe difficulty I have had this semester has caused me to question my future in this program. If the 40+ hours per week of work needed for this course is indicative of any future courses, continuing to pursue this degree will be incompatible with maintaining my full-time job and family responsibilities.  I understand that Tech’s rigor is a part of its great reputation, and fully expected my classes to be very challenging. However, I did not expect to be subjected to unreasonable expectations and poor communication by professors in a professional graduate curriculum like the “weed-out” courses I had during undergrad.\n",

            "text": "First, let me say that this class is great.   You will learn a lot if you've never taken a course on HCI.  Dr. Joyner is very active, both on the slack channel and the Piazza forums.  He is very helpful and I will take other courses by him.  There is very little TA involvement though.  \n\nAbout the course:\nThere are 10 assignments that are basically reports.  They require around 1600 words per paper.  These are fine and will help you understand the material well.  They can get a bit boring after awhile though.\n\nThere are two projects.  The individual project isn't difficult at all and I felt it was just like another assignment.  The group project was a repeat of 5 of the assignments you had already done, but now in a group.  If you can choose your own group.  My group was fine, but didn't communicate well.  I felt that I did a majority of the work.  \n\nThere are too many readings.  They start off interesting and get worse as you go.  I quit reading them after the midterm because I needed to spend more time in another class.  By doing so, my midterm grade went down 10 points.  This implies to me that they aren't that important.\n\nThe tests are open book.  I found them to be rough.  We got two hours to take them, but I think in the future they will only be 90 minutes.  Anyways, I didn't do the readings for them and still got a good grade, but I used all two hours and they were open book.  If the tests are not two hours in the future, you may want to make sure you do the readings as I always ran out of time when I searched through the readings for the answers to test.\n\nOverall, great class.  Loved it and Dr. Joyner is fantastic.  I highly recommend this class.  It would make a good pairing with a second course.",

Perhaps this is easier for those who had algorithms as an undergrad, you but don't need it to be successful in this class.  \n\nWith the exception of the dynamic programming, homework  only took a couple hours to complete.  However, doing only the assigned problems was not enough for me to do well on the exams, I did most of the problems in the book and others I could find online as well.  For me,  workload was light most weeks,  but spiked just before exams.\n\nI don't think theres a need to prepare in advance.  I came in without a CS undergrad or advance prep and did well.

The assignments are intense but overall manageable if you start early and use the resources available (I found the slack community the most helpful followed by piazza). The exams are rough. This semester we were given a week to complete a take home exam for the midterm and final. The exams are more open-ended than the assignments and require a lot of time. I think a few things could help students prior to taking the class:\n\n1. Be comfortable with python and numpy\n2. Take a course or two covering related topics prior to this course (ML4T, AI4R, DVA, ML, etc)\n3. Start everything early and ask questions.\n4. Complete any extra credit you can\n\nI felt like this class was definitely worth it for those interested in ML/AI and is probably better earlier in the program.

There are 8 assignments that u can even start working on from the first day (of course not recommended). The videos are excellent - short, to the point and very close to the subject matter and the assignment. \n\n#### Assignments\nAll the assignments are evenly spaced and equivalently weighted. I would recommend referring to all the information \n at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Main_Page to learn more about this course itself.\n\nFew over achievers might grumble :), but the first part of the course (mini course for pandas) was extremely important for the final part of the assignments\n\n#### Exams\nThe exams are intended to test if your understood the videos and the concepts and does not try to trick you out of your grades. For the midterm, there are crowd sourced question banks whose intentions are to make sure you actually understood the various parts of the course. If you have gone through them all and figured out the basics behind them, the midterm should be simple enough though it is closed book and proctored.\n\nThe final does not have a question bank, but the same methodology of going through your videos and material should make it simple enough.\n\n#### Parting words\nThe last three assignments as noted as indeed challenging and equivalently given two weeks to complete. You can even start them on the first day though there might be tiny edits to the grading script at a later point.\n\nBut this is one of the best constructed courses and if you have some background in python, should be simple to pick up and any insights in finance would be an added booster.\n\n_Note: Though the course is constructed exceptionally well, it is not an easy A and you would still need to put in the hours required. Especially the two assignments marked as \"Very challenging\" easily took 20-25 hours over two weeks. _",

Be brutally honest about your skillsets to be matched correctly. There were few teams who had lot of trouble leading to disparaging discussions in Piazza.\n\nIf you have Junits and/or Java development experience, the assignments itself should be a breeze. The only problem would be a black-box testing assignment with no clue about what bugs you are looking for. I would recommend living with whatever is possible as at the end of the day, it accounts only for a small part of your final grade.\n\nIn the group project, attempt to identify an integration lead, ideally with Android experience. It would make all team mates lives simpler with each building one or more components and the lead integrating them together.\n\nI was the lead and all my other team mates either had paired this with other courses or were either getting a baby or moving, so getting the right team and responsibilities is crucial. There are 3 deliverables as a group and getting the dynamics is important to get them delivered.\n\n### Exams/Tests\nThere are no exams and all grading is done via Assignments\n\n### Office hours\nThis is the only 1 course out of the 3 that i have taken where the professor actually does a live office hours.\n\n### Parting words\nIf you have Java experience, this is a simple no-brainer class which can be clubbed together with another course. If you have no Java experience or haven't worked in a group, i would tread a bit light and look for an alternative if possible. The learnings are not that really extraordinary nor the effort worth the merit.",

Compared to my previous OMSCS course (6300), I would say I averaged twice as many hours reading through the (often dense) textbook and studying for exams. The real gem was the project, where we learned everything from designing databases with diagrams and understanding DB concepts (EER, IFD, relations), to implementing them using languages and tools I'd never programmed in before (MySQL, Php, HTML, MAMP). It provided me with not only a working prototype of a database in action, but also with a great experience working with teammates who I plan to keep in contact with. By comparison, the four exams only nominally helped to prepare us for each phase of the project, and seemed much more difficult than initial self-study and sample exams would indicate. I think that pacing in the course could be improved; the beginning felt very rushed to complete everything, whereas by the end it felt like there wasn't enough to keep us busy. It was up to us to plan our learning material consumption, but the deadlines with exams and project phases did not always give ideal time lengths to prepare. Professor Mark and the TAs are knowledgeable and approachable, though if you really want questions answered be prepared to ask during office hours. Overall, it was a challenging course and I liked certain parts more than others, but I definitely learned a lot.",

            "text": "Took this course on my first sem in OMS. It was a useful course to me because I got to learn big data technologies like spark, hadoop, scala etc., - but you could have learned more if you just read a book on each of those subjects as this course does not go deep into each technology.\n\nThere were a lot of difficulties setting up env in the beginning. TAs were kinda responsive, but not very helpful. The homeworks were not structured well at all! I did have plenty of time to complete each homework, but I had no idea whether my code was right or wrong! There was no feedback or guidance on this part. So, for many assignments - students who check their code on few test cases after submission learned that they had missed a minor edge case which was only in the TA's test set and lost marks due to that. IMHO, if you actually want to learn big data technologies, grab a few books with big data tech. names on them and just do the programs in the book. You'll learn a lot more that way.\n\nThe only interesting part of the course was the project (which fortunately was a huge chunk of your final grade). You are allowed to choose from a wide range of pre-selected topics. The project can be done in a group of 3 or solo. You can also get access to datasets which are normally not available for free access online. I would say this was the only useful thing I got out of this course.\n\nI would assume this course is going to be restructured or rebuilt soon because of the complaints that were made during my semester. Overall, if you are not comfortable learning and implementing with 3-4 technologies in a short period of time, you are going to have a hard time. If you want to take this course, pair it with some lighter course and read additional big data material on your own to get the most out of this course.",

            "text": "Took this as my first course in OMS. I had almost zero experience in CV, but had a lot of experience in python and numpy.\nThere are a LOT of lectures. LOT of content to cover. The lectures were done by Prof. Bobick (who is no longer with GaTech), he makes the content interesting it by explaining concepts clearly and breaking difficult concepts into small, simple and easily digestible chunks of information.\n\nThere are 6 assignments, 1 final project and 1 exam (worth 15% of your grade). The assignments do a good job of covering all the important and interesting concepts of the course. Some assignments are difficult in the sense that - you can get it \"working\" relatively well, but to get the output they expect you'd have spend A LOT (extra emphasis on lot) of time parameter tuning.  The exam was open-book, but don't let that fool you! you still need to have a good grasp of a pretty much the entire syllabus to do well in the exam!\n\nThe final project requirements are not straightforward. There is a lot of emphases was placed on your report - you had to read papers and follow strict requirements for each project topic.\n\nThe TAs were helpful in Piazza in the beginning, but the activity kinda fell off after the first few assignments IMHO. Prof did not interact with the class via Piazza during my term. The Slack group was a godsend. Discussions on slack with other students was what helped me through the assignments.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting course. CV is a very widely-applicable subject and I suggest if you are planning on having a career or doing research in ML or similar fields, do take this subject!",

            "text": "Background:\nThis is my first course in the OMSCS program and I intentionally took this course for two reasons.  First, I was interested in learning more about computer networks.  Next, from reviews on OMSCentral, this seemed to be on average one of the easier courses, so it provided a good stepping stone into the program.  I have an aerospace degree and have worked in the world of defense software for about 4 years now.\n\nPros:\n- The head TA (Stacia Stokes) is very attentive and present on Piazza.  Two thumbs up here.\n- Each project has enough time to complete.\n- The lectures, articles/readings, and projects do tie together for the most part.\n- You do learn a lot about both the historical and modern concepts of network programming.  They don't go too deep, but that's mainly because there is a lot of ground to cover.\n- Two instances of extra credit were offered (one for weekly discussions, another for an extra portion of the last project)\n\nCons:\n- The articles were difficult to read through.  Interesting topics, but the important points were buried in the article (typical techincal paper...).\n- The lecture videos can be a bit jumpy in its explanations, though it still holds to the overall lecture topic.\n- I had hoped to do a little more with software-defined networks (SDN's)\n- Projects 2 and 3 were intense (but if you get past those, you'll be fine.)\n- Test questions could sometimes be vague, and thus difficult to answer.\n- ProctorTrack may be more of a pain than it's worth.\n\nOverall I'm happy with this course.  I recommend it as a first course for anyone starting the program without a network background.  This course uses Python, so you'd benefit from already knowing it, but that's not a necessity.  Time spent each week really varied and depended on the project.  I probably spent time more than I needed to, so take that into account for the \"weekly workload\" stat.",

The material wasn't particularly difficult, but there is room to go as deep as you like with the above and beyond portion of the assignments.  I would recommend getting practice with Numpy if you are not familiar with it.  A cheap tripod was very useful for some of the assignments and I borrowed a DSLR for the camera obscura, which would have been much more difficult with a smartphone camera.  It was well organized and the assignments were fun.  I would recommend taking this course if you have any interest in photography or working with images.",

The projects also aren't finalized until pretty late, but the changes were almost always nothing. But the class is interesting enough. Its a light introduction to machine learning, and a medium introduction to finance. You aren't going to leave this class and be Warren Buffet, or know everything you need to know to make a high frequency trader, but you'll have a decent grasp, and give you enough of a teaser to let you know if you want explore ML or finance further.\n\nClass itself was pretty easy. Projects could be easy, or hard depending on you. I spent a lot of time messing around, but if I had focused I probably could have finished things a lot faster and easier. \n\nId recommend it to someone who wants a light introduction to machine learning.\n\n",

It is easy to get an A in this class as long as you spend the time. Generally you will be able to keep working/debugging code until you are certain that it is 100% correct. You have 3 weeks per HW assignment, which is reasonable as long as you start working immediately and don't procrastinate on the group project.\n\nMy only gripe about this class is that it should be worth 6 credit hours instead of 3.

Compared to other courses such as Computational Photography or Computer Vision I would say the projects are 'easier' conceptually but 'significantly less straightforward' to implement.\n\nEg a project which was basically 'implement particle filters' which I've implemented at least 3 times before took 10x as much time to finish as in other classes. This is due to a lack of scaffolding provided compared to other courses (you have to integrate your code and write almost everything that's not related to the core algorithm). I will say they did cover how to implement particle filters quite well. Just that the bulk of your time in the projects is not spent on the core algorithms the lectures cover.\n\nThe projects build on one another so if you didn't manage to get earlier projects be ready to devote significant time on later projects catching up. Lastly the grades are all or nothing (very much like real life) unlike other courses which test each part of the project separately.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the concepts taught in this class you will struggle with having enough time to implement them. That being said the lectures do cover the material quite well. It's just due to the all or nothing nature it'll be hard for you to know whether it is a bug with the algorithms or an integration bug somewhere else.\n\nSemi extra credit in terms of additional projects/challenges was offered, but I don't consider them realistic given the time devoted to core projects.\n\nI would NOT recommend this to new students to the program. For the final project around 1/3 of the students got 0% on the grade on a piazza poll and less than 1/2 got >50% due to the all or nothing nature.\n_____\nTip for project 3: Ignore almost everything that is suggested for this project by lecture. The biggest challenge is not related to what the project seems to want to test you on at all. If you waste your time on the algorithm covered in lecture. You won't have time to work on the actual time consuming part of the project. You won't even need anything you implemented in Project 2 or Project 1B. Just use the strategy from Project 1A to deal with inputs and focus on the real challenge. Learned this the hard way when I ran out of time and discovered my optimized implementation wasn't even needed or used in the final solution. Also for the mini project before hand, there's a significantly simpler alternative that's much easier than the suggested algorithm. Save your time for Project 2/3 instead of the miniproject.",

            "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and it really changed my perspective on how to design interfaces.  Dr. Joyner is a fantastic instructor, and this course was one of the best I've taken in the OMSCS program.  \n\nBefore I took this course, I had a vague sense of what made a poor user interface, and this course teaches you the underlying principles of usability and user-centered design.  After the course, I can now analyze and articulate how an interface could be improved based on user-centered design principles.\n\nThe course has two main lesson tracks that were taught in parallel: **Methods** and **Principles**. \n\n **Methods** focuses on the process of conducting HCI research such as understanding regulations about testing with human subjects, performing needfinding (understanding needs of the user), brainstorming approaches, prototyping, and evaluating designs.  All of this is comprises the design lifecycle.  \n\n**Principles** focuses on the design principles in HCI, such as the *Gulf of Execution* (how the user figures out what they want to do and how to do it) and the *Gulf of Evaluation* (did the interface respond how the user expected?).  You also will learn about concepts that improve usability and the limitations of users (human abilities).  This was my favorite portion of the course.\n\n**Assignments:** Weekly assignments were due that usually required 1200-1500 words of writing based on that week's lecture content.  I found these assignments to be easy but useful.  I usually spent 3-4 hours writing each assignment, but the **Methods** assignments required outside work that took a few hours to perform (conducting needfinding with others, developing prototypes, etc). \n\n**Tests:** There are two tests that cover the first half of the course and the second half of the course.  The two tests are open-book and open-note (including Udacity and papers) extremely straightforward (not necessarily easy), but there's no trickery involved or gotcha questions.  Dr. Joyner provided a terrific analysis after the exams to identify problematic questions and other potential test issues.  \n\n**Projects:**\nThere is an individual project and a group project where you go through a round of the design lifecycle by yourself (individual project) and then as a group (group project).  These projects primarily reinforce the material in the **Methods** lectures as you practice what you've learned in them.\n\n**tl;dr:** Excellent course.  Not super difficult.  Very enjoyable.  Great if you want to learn more about designing good UI/UX.",

            "text": "**Overall: **  It's a hard course even with a strong math background.  I did not find the assignments to be very helpful (they sapped my enthusiasm), and the tests are hard.  TAs were not very responsive in Piazza this semester (Spring 2018).  This class is too laissez-faire (in my opinion) and fails to provide effective feedback on assignments.\n\nI had a fair amount of ML experience from previous learning (I had watched the Supervised Learning lectures a year earlier, and taken other AI classes in the past) coming into this course, but this course was still challenging.  \n\nThe lecture quality is pretty good; the professors Isbell and Littman are very knowledgable and their humorous banter in the videos is funny.  I liked the conversational style they used in the videos - it's a dialogue between the teacher (alternates between Charles and Michael) and the other plays an inquisitive student who asks questions.\n\nThe assignments were super open-ended and I felt graded quite harshly given the lack of concrete direction.  There seemed to be a hidden rubric used to grade submissions that was not shared with students in the assignment descriptions.  I felt frustrated with the assignments because I felt like I wasn't really learning much but simply twiddling hyperparameter knobs in order to generate plots for the report.  Further, the feedback that I received from the TAs was usually  weak and non-specific after they'd take off 30 points.  I spent probably 30ish hours on average for the problem sets.\n\nI wish the course offered more structure (\"Students have successfully used this GitHub repo <some_url> for Assignment #1.  Train the model, plot learning curves (accuracy vs. time and accuracy vs. iterations), do tasks X, Y, Z\") rather than giving vague instructions (\"pick some interesting problems and fiddle with the hyperparameters for algorithms A, B, and C.  Plot some stuff and tell us your observations\").  I'd also have appreciated a more specific rubric for what's expected on the assignments - I'd love to go on the intellectual journey, but please tell me the waypoints!\n\nThe exams were hard but fair.\n\nI'm happy to have this course behind me.  There were high points (lecture content is good), but the assignments were simply not helpful for my learning.",

The lecturers (Isbell and Littman) are very engaging but the material itself can be quite dense. And the research papers are tough to get through if you are not used to reading academic CS papers. There are also weekly office hours with the TAs which were very helpful. The TAs were very accessible, hosting office hours and appearing in the Slack group.\n\nThe structure of the class is 2 homework assignments with a week to complete, then a project with 2 weeks to complete, for a total of 6 HW and 3 projects. There was an opportunity for an extra 10 points on one HW assignment. The assignments are released in 3 batches, so you can work ahead to some degree but couldn't finish the semester all at once.\n\nThe homework was challenging conceptually at times but usually did not require much code. I thought all of the homeworks did a good job of reinforcing concepts from the lectures. All 6 assignments were submitted through a web app that gave immediate feedback on your results. Each question on the assignments had a 10 submission limit to prevent brute-forcing solutions.\n\nTwo projects involved reproducing results from research papers, and one involved training an agent for an OpenAI Gym environment, using an algorithm from a research paper(s) of your choice. The deliverable was the code on Github and a 5-page report on your results. \n\nI did not enjoy the projects based on reproducing papers and didn't find the topics very interesting. The OpenAI project was quite interesting but very time-consuming. Training time for the agent could take many hours so iterating on a concept was difficult.\n\nOverall I thought the course was very well done even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was more theory and less practice than I would have liked, but that's a matter of personal preference.",

I completed a computer engineering degree in 2014 as my only previous computer science exposure before this program for comparison to your circumstances.\n\nThis course is lighter compared to the harder courses in terms of pace and difficulty. The projects are less frequent at about one a month and are easier to figure out, especially when you have no background in the topic. I fell in this category for all of the projects so I averaged about 20 hours total a project between coding and writing the report. If you have significant experience in C with buffer overflows, or HTML/Javascript, then all of these projects can be completed in one night for you. The quizzes are straight from the lectures and book, so the book has great value for these. The tests focus on details and terminology from large amounts of chapters and lectures so memorizing that much information is the hardest part. The TAs and professor run the course very well and all our issues with Canvas will be figured out by the time later students take this course.\n\nI recommend this course as a great first course if you are coming from a technical background that is not computer science or engineering. This can also be paired with the harder courses like AI, ML, and GA. ",

The projects could be a breeze if your mental model matched that of the TA that wrote the grader.  But if your implementation runs afoul of the grader (even if it works locally and passes tests), get ready for many hours of hair-pulling trying to figure-out the inner workings of the black box that is the grader.  The tests also bugged me.  They were \"fun\" in the sense that there was some humor to them, but they're basically word problems that include a small amount of AI concepts and a lot of high-stakes arithmetic.  You're literally building spreadsheets and/or writing code to solve problems and if your answer isn't accurate to within the sixth decimal, you get zero points.  Quite tedious if you ask me.",

I had learned the basics of Python in CN but I had not used numpy at all before this course. Additionally, I completed a computer engineering undergraduate degree in 2014 as my only other exposure to computer science before this program. This information is all to compare to your own circumstances.\n\nOverall, this course was by far my favorite while also being the most difficult and most work thus far. Some projects took 10 hours while others took up to 50 hours due to my background. The projects are very diverse so if you've never seen some of these topics until this course, then your learning curve will be longer for each project like mine. The majority of the projects had extra credit that rewards those who know their coding and material. I highly recommend scoring as many points as possible on the projects as the midterm and finals are intense.\n\nBoth exams are take-home exams that are 35-45 pages each with a full week to complete. I spent 40-50 hours on them to achieve a level above the median to make up for my lackluster performance on a project. These exams will thoroughly test your knowledge of each part of the course, which I prefer as you can't fake your knowledge. You are only allowed the class resources and book for these exams. No INTERNET, collaboration and so forth is allowed. The book is a must due to the complexity of the concepts and use for projects and exams.\n\nI highly recommend this course if you have never taken an AI course before as you will learn a ton. However, honestly gauge your knowledge and skills beforehand to see how much of your life you will have to give to be able to succeed. After taking two courses as a full-time student, I do not recommend another course at the same time if you work full-time unless you have expertise in python, numpy, and AI concepts.",

Even on Sundays sometimes!\n\nI did not like how heavy the grading favors the tests - I spent 100+ hours on the projects and probably less than 10 studying for the exams, but the exams are weighted as 60% of grade.  However this may be necessary because projects do not go into a lot of the information presented in the course.

Highly suggest you get a better computer in order to run the android studio smoothly. It saves your testing time for quite a bit.\nI think the Individual project is a little bit easy and less practical in term software design. Though it covered the course content of black-box testing and refactoring, we didn't get to practice that on a complete software program.(It is a small command line utility)\n\nIf you think you don't have any CS background, you could take this course as the only one and first course. If you have any background in Java or familiar with another programming language, I would suggest you to take this class with another medium or easy class in your first semester or take it in the summer.\n\nEnjoy this class with good discussion and helps from classmates!\n\n\n",

For the second half of the assignment, it can be done more easily by working 2 weeks straight without the smart part.\n\nYour fellow classmates will reach a 100 in the assignments and drive the median up, so that means you have to as well.

In both exams, there was new information entirely! There were wikipedia links to start learning mathematical concepts MID EXAM. Even if it was briefly covered in the lecture/book, it will be there on the exam. If the lecturer says \"We won't get into this too much but here is a brief explanation\" - don't worry, the exam will get into it in depth!

            "text": "##### Overview\n\nLet me preface my review by saying that I went into this course really excited to learn about Machine Learning (with a mild interest in trading), having chosen to specialize in it through OMS CS. Unfortunately, this is a Finance class under the guise of a \"Machine Learning\" class. I put Machine Learning in quotes, because even Andrew Ng's outdated, free Coursera class provides a better introduction to ML compared to this one. By the way, there is zero mathematical background required for what is taught in this course, which is disappointing. If you compare the curriculum to Stanford/UC Berkeley/MIT, you will see that they are miles apart.\n\n##### What You'll Learn\nYou will implement: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Trees, Bagging/Boosting, and Q-learning. The rest of the course is about finance, with some Python syntax thrown into the mix. In addition, this course doesn't feel like a master's level class due to the amount of hand-holding it does (step by step instructions on what to do, you just need to convert it into Python syntax).\n\n##### Positives\nThe videos for this course are well-done, are interesting and are directly tied to the projects, unlike other classes. Also, because there's no curve, the classroom environment becomes very positive (not competitive) and people genuinely try to help everyone else.",

            "text": "I found this course to be very enjoyable in general. The lectures were a bit hit or miss, but the assignments were usually good about guiding you through the problems. I came into the course with some programming experience but only very little exposure to Python, and I thought it was a great introduction to Python including Pandas, NumPy and SciPy. The later assignments focused more on mathematical theory and concepts useful to data analytics such as optimization problems and algorithms, which were very math-y but also very helpful to reinforce my understanding of the workings behind these methods. It helped that there was a refresher on the linear algebra and calculus included as part of the instructional materials.\n\nThe fact that the assignments are autograded with unlimited submissions means you have as much time as you need to test your solutions and get as much credit as you can. The assignments are released well ahead of time so if you need to get a head start and give yourself some time off between assignments that's totally feasible. Some assignments were much easier than others, so I'd say the avg workload was about 4-8 hours per week.\n\nThe exams worked much the same way homework did, open note/internet with no proctoring, but were much longer than the typical homework assignment and with a time limit (both midterms were 24 hrs, the final was 36 hrs). I spent about 5-8 hours with each of the three exams, but I know other students struggled with the amount of time they needed to complete the tests. The professor and TAs were responsive and made some changes to the exam format to help accommodate the students who had issues though, which I appreciated even though it didn't impact me much.\n\nOverall, highly recommended course. As someone who had a programming background, I think it's still worthwhile to take unless you're already very comfortable using Python, Pandas, NumPy and SciPy.",

            "text": "I absolutely loved this course, and I'm very glad I chose it for my first semester. Dr. Sokol's lectures were engaging, informative, and clearly understandable. I don't know if there's much he could have done better with the lectures, they were that good. Even when he was working through formulae and variables, I was still able to follow along most of the time, and if I wasn't, just a couple repeat viewings and I was on the same page. The course surveys countless topics at a rapid speed, but I never felt like it was moving too fast. I'm amazed at how much I know now compared to the start of the semester.\n\nHomeworks mostly use R for building and evaluating models. I'd had no experience with R before starting the course, so the early going was a bit rough, but once I got up to speed I was much more comfortable. The assignments are designed to set you on your own path of discovery and learning, and I found that I benefited the most from them when I approached them that way. On the weeks where I was more time-constrained or felt a bit lost in R, I found the TA office hours sessions to be very helpful. I never attended one live, I only ever watched video recordings. I did my best not to carbon copy everything the TAs had done, because they basically provided you with the answers most of the time - even something as simple as changing the names of variables helped me internalize the solution better than copying everything to the letter. \n\nPeer reviewing has pros and cons, the biggest pro is that I saw a few really impressive submissions that actually taught me a thing or two (especially when people took the time to create Jupyter notebooks out of their submissions) but the worst con was reviewing some of the poorer submissions or the ones that just lifted the answers from the TA office hours with no elaboration. So depending on the luck of the draw you could find the peer review process to be educational or not. Also, feedback from other students was very inconsistent, sometimes you'd get great suggestions about how you could have done things differently, but most of the time it seems I got no feedback at all or something brief like \"good job\" with no detail. \n\nExams were very fair, and I didn't mind the proctoring as much as I thought I would (but I'm also not a parent so a quiet, private session was easy for me to manage). Exam questions usually required you to think through every answer and choose carefully, and I thought they did a good job testing my understanding of the material.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this course highly enough, and I strongly suggest taking it in your first semester as an OMSA student if you can.

The video are well done but many of them are just walkthroughs of your homework assignment that week.  The exams are insane.  For the two mid terms you are given 24 hours to complete the exam.  However, unless you are a very experienced programmer, you can expect to spend between 12 and 15 hours of work to complete each mid term (based on the results of slack polls).    Again, if you are python pro, you'll finish the exams in like 6 hours, but if you're not, plan on clearing your schedule for 24 hours because you will most likely need the time.  The mid term was also like this although we were given 36 hours to complete the exam instead of 24.  An improvement to be sure but still a very stressful and intense 36 hours.  To give some perspective, someone pointed out in Slack, 18 hours is the length of the California Bar Exam administered over 3 days.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that you'll spend that much time on each exams over one 24 hours period.     ",

Sometimes lecture materials were not enough to get 100 in homework as a grade scope of 100 required \"a deeper solution than expected\". TA's weekly office hour was very very helpful to clarify confusions in a homework. Few troll in peers can give you a low grade without any comment, which is frustrating. But, most of reviews I got was reasonable and helped me to improve. If they don't change the system in the next semester, your assignments will be reviewed by three different randomly chosen peers and assigned grade will be a median of the three grades.\n\nExams were fair. There were few tricky questions that require some thinking. What I liked the most for the exams was that it was designed to test your understanding on the models, not memorization. \n\nOverall it is very good class and I've learned a lot through this class. I took CSE6040 and ISYE6501 at the same time. I recommend to take ISYE 6501 prior to CSE 6040 if you are considering one class among these two.",

            "text": "While there is room for improvement, this class definitely isn't quite the hot mess that it was in some previous semesters. Like the Fall 2017 semester, Professor Joyner once again joined the instructor team to help ensure things ran more or less smoothly. And by \"help\", I mean he appeared to be \"the\" instructor for the course (despite what the course sign-up states, Professor Chakraborty was not involved in anything student-facing). Dr. Joyner and the TAs did a nice job keeping us up-to-date and on-track, though it's a continued pet peeve of mine when an instructor literally ignores their students for the entire semester.\n\nContent-wise, the first half of the course's lectures were pretty good. Dr Lebanon's explanations and manner-of-speaking tend to make things needlessly complicated, especially when getting into the more math-heavy topics, but nothing was too overwhelming. The second half of the course was a lot harder to follow, again mainly due to the way the content was presented. Several students posted alternate sources of information on Piazza that made the concepts much easier to understand. It's like too much focus was placed on the theory and exact formulas rather than what it actually means in practice.\n\nThe projects and homeworks were all pretty fair, in my opinion, even though I came in with no R experience whatsoever. Some assignments were intimidating to start, but became more manageable after spending some time playing with them. The TAs also posted helpful hints for some assignments. The exams were both a bit crude, handled via ProctorTrack. The midterm had a lot of disagreement with wording and ambiguity. The instructor team did eventually address a few of the questions about a month later and gave some points back, but other questions were never clarified.\n\nGrade-wise, it still seems fairly easy to get an A as long as you're not waiting until the last minute to do an assignment (and almost everything is available from the first week of class, so there's no need to wait). Four homeworks worth 10% each, two projects worth 20% each, two exams worth 10% each, and 5 activities worth 1% each. Since that's 105%, you've got 15% of leeway to stay in \"A\" range. There didn't seem to be many issues with grading as long as you followed the requirements.\n\nCommunication-wise is where things could have been better. The TAs were great for office hours on Slack and generally responsive on Piazza, but private posts would get ignored and it seemed like there were some topics the TAs didn't want to get involved with.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty good class if you're interested in R, but the lectures were often awkward to watch and the algebra portions didn't really add much to the course in any meaningful way.",

The first 2-3 projects being the hardest of the bunch.\n\nEvery week you are expected to read chapters out of the book. If you don't, boy are you in for a fun time with the midterm and final.\n\nMidterm and Final are take home exams and are given a week to complete them. I spent at least 20 hours on each one. If you work full time, expect your entire night and most of the weekend that week to be spent working on the exam.\nWhile I loathed the exams, I learned a lot from them. They cover all of the topics you read through, unfortunately you have to learn as you go. They release challenge questions throughout the semester that were previous exam questions. These _somewhat_ help, but are not really the full cigar in terms of adequately preparing you for the exam. If you kept up on the readings, you'll at least know where to look to find the relevant topic.\n\nDr. Starner is not very present in this class outside of the lectures. He hosted office hours before each exam and that was it. He rarely posted on Piazza. Some TAs were better than others, but they were overall okay.\n\nI don't recommend taking this class as your first course. Come in understanding python and numpy. A good understanding of probability will also help and will make Bayes Nets much easier. I spent a long time figuring it out but am still weak on Probability Theory. \n\nI also recommend _not_ pairing this course with any others. Each week is pretty demanding and you'll really want to spend time understanding the topics and not feeling rushed with the projects.\n\n\nAll in all I am walking away from this class with a much better, and deeper understanding of AI topics.

            "text": "This was my first class in the program, and I really enjoyed it. I came into this course with plenty of C knowledge, and I thought I understood Operating Systems concepts well (turns out I did not). I would say with my background, this course is more like a medium difficulty because of the amount of content, but for those new to C or OS concepts, I suspect it would be quite hard. That said, it is an achievable course, and with the generous curving policy it does not aim to make your life difficult. If you complete the work and give the class a fair shot, you will probably earn a B. Earning an A takes a bit more work.\n\nProjects are described in better detail on other reviews. With my C background, Pr1 took about 10-12 hours, Pr2 took about 4-6, Pr3 took about 8, and Pr4 took about 5. I would say they are difficult, but at no point did I feel like I was lost without any clue what to do next. If you reference the readme, make use of search functionality in Google, Piazza, and Slack, and when that fails, ask relevant questions, the projects are quite achievable without any existing C knowledge. But I will admit they would be quite difficult if you haven't been exposed to much C. I would say you could double or triple my times if you're trying to learn C along the way. It would be a good way to learn C, for what it's worth.\n\nExams are difficult. I thought I understood OS material already, but the course went much deeper into how things work under the hood. It does a good job of exposing you to important academic research in the field, and gives you some of the early building blocks of how things came to be. The exams are multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank for calculations, but they are far from easy. You will not do well if you haven't absorbed the lecture material and given the paper readings a fair shake. The exams are both quite fair, though. The practice questions provided give you a very good view of what will be on the test, but again, they are not easy.\n\nThe course makes it very easy to participate. A TA has opened up a private paid slack instance which to me was invaluable this semester. It allowed many people a place to get more instantaneous help with projects and material, as well as get to know each other and create decent relationships, for an online program. If Piazza isn't your thing, this is a great resource to have. Either Slack and Piazza participation counts for a small portion of the final grade, but there are plenty of opportunities to contribute.\n\nMy advice on this course would be to brush up on basic C concepts, and hit the ground running. Use the first week to get ahead on lectures and readings, so that when the first project comes out you can start work immediately. The only people I observed struggling with it to the point of not completing it were those who started it halfway through the deadline. There is generous time given to complete the projects, which makes it ripe for procrastination, but do not. I would also advise you to get ahead on the second half of the course - the material on the final is about 2 times the content of the material on the midterm, so work quickly through that material to allow plenty of time to review for the final.\n\nIf you come in with some interest in the subject, it is a very rewarding course. I like that it doesn't hold a grade over your head, which helps with enjoyability... but you do have to do the work to obtain it. In my opinion it makes an excellent first course, as it is well-run, the TAs are available and helpful, the professor actively participates despite the large class sizes, and the projects are well put together and help expand on the material you learn.",

This was the only course I took this semester and I struggled to keep up with the amount of practice and preparation that was required. \n\nIf you are reading this review and hoping to prepare for the class, study DP, NP Reductions and Max-Flow as well as Min-Cut. These are the main topics you will be tested on. There are graph algorithms as well, but you will never be asked to find a shortest path or anything like that, you will need to know how the algorithm works and based on the problem presented you will need to identify whether or not the algorithm can be used to solve the problem.\n\nThe lectures in my opinion are only good if you read the book first, then watch them once as you take notes and then watch them again just for content. So in other words they are not as good as other OMSCS courses. If you plan on grasping the material just by looking at the lectures, you probably won't because the lectures go quite fast and they only explain the basics of how to do the problems. A lot of times I also found myself going on YouTube to try to look at different explanations because I thought the explanations given were either not clear or just not good enough. \n\nI suggest taking this course on its own and if you have a few classes left, perhaps a semester before you graduate so you can re-take it if you do not get a B. \n\nI would also suggest to become a regular on Piazza and do all the homeworks even though they are not worth many points.

            "text": "I took this course along with DVA for my first semester. I liked DVA, but I thought this course was much better - I loved it. \n\n**Positives**:\n\nDr Thrun's lectures are fascinating, and he has boundless enthusiasm for the subject. That enthusiasm didn't just come through in the lectures, but in the three office hours he gave throughout the semester. These office hours were interesting too, and he took questions from students ranging from project implementation details to research and industry topics. Pretty cool.\n\nDr Summet's office hours were very useful, and he held them every week. He was also very involved on Piazza and personally answered many student questions. \n\nThe projects are fun. The course doesn't cover *that* many topics, but you will become an expert in A*/DP path planning, Kalman/Particle filters, and PID control. When/if you finish the projects, you'll feel proud. And if you're like me,  you'll replay the Python scripts over and over once you're done just to watch what you made.\n\nIn my semester, the students on Piazza were valuable and supportive. \n\nThere were no tests, and the homework answers were given for free (they still counted towards your grade). No group projects. You'll have many weeks to prepare for most of the projects.\n\n**Negatives**\n\nThe projects really seem all-or-nothing. They use an automated grader to score your projects, and you'll probably have to spend double digit hours just to maybe get a tiny amount of points from the sample grader. The real test cases they will grade with are not given in advance, but sample cases are provided that closely match. Don't underestimate the time commitment you'll need for those projects. We had a week extension on the last project, and still many people reported that they could not get *any* points on their test runs before having to turn it in. \n\n**Tips**\n\nPython is heavily used, and it will be valuable if you're already familiar with it. Start the projects right when they become available. Try to do the projects in stages, like making sure you have basic functionality before meeting the full requirements. \n\nI wouldn't go so far to say that the lectures didn't cover what you need for the projects (like others have stated). The core of my logic for every project was solely stuff we learned in class. That being said, there are implementation details that will take a while to work out, and parameters that will need to be heavily tuned. You'll have to get creative.",

The first two projects were 60+ hr  of work each for me.  I did well on the third because it was easier and also am more comfortable C.  I'm guessing a student with a C programming background could complete the projects in a quarter the time I spent.  It did take significant effort up front to understand the requirements of the projects.  You can do this class without C in you skillset, but you will spend 10+ hours a week the first half of the course catching up on it because the projects require it.  Working full time, tackling this course material, teaching myself C, and another class on top of that was not the best idea.  \n\nThe professor, TAs, and Piazza/slack community were great in getting assistance with the projects and answering questions. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are well presented and organized.  Due to my efforts catching up on C and taking another class, I did not get to dive into the material as much as I would have liked.  One thing that I wish the class provided was more assignments related to the readings.  Whether essay or simple quizzes, I think it would help students take more from this material to have it tested in more than just the two exams.  Only half the readings relate at all to the projects.  No textbook required, but you should have some OS programming reference material handy.\n\nOverall very worthwhile course but A LOT of work if you don't know C!\n\nsemi-pro tip: Set up and get comfortable with an IDE ( I used VS code, many used CLion) the first week or prior to taking the class.

And it’s what interviewers ask about.\n\n- Lectures are very clear and indepth. Didn’t need the book. Also any prereqs are covered in the lectures, except for graph theory. If you’re dying to prep before the course starts, maybe Graph Theory and BFS.Dijkstra are a good idea. Other than that I don;t see a reason to start early. Go into this class with a clear mind cause you’re gonna think and study A LOT.\n- Exams are fair. Not easy, and not impossible. Just the right balance to test how well you understand the material, and can apply it to new problems.\n- AWESOME staff. Professor is very active on Piazza, he is a true educator that cares about his students. Same with TAs who held 3 office hours per weekto answer HW questions, and any otherproblems from the book...etc.\n- HWs, althoughof very low weight are extremely important. As well as practicing on your own with extra problems from the book or anywhere else. Practice is key here. You gotta train your brain on these kinds of problems. Don’t be disappointed if you can’t solve any of the Dynamic Programming problems. Just make sure you practice enough, and you’ll be fine.\n- There was a coding project. It was very easy and not much of a learning opportunity. There’s room for improvement here.\n- 3 midterms and a final. Midterms are not cumulative, so you can dive deep and practice specific topics as much as you want.\n- This class is a marathon run. There a re no dull moments. Every week you’ll either be busy working on a HW or prepping for an exam. That’s why try not to burn yourself by prepping too much before the semester starts.\n\nBottom line. This is the best run class in OMSCS. And one of the most important to take. Can’t believe there’s a specialization (Interactive Intelligence) that doesn’t mandate this course.",

Overall, the course was very descriptive when it came to forcing the understanding of the few types of regression models discussed in the class. After taking this class, the takeaways should be the model code and the interpretation of the models both in a statistical way and in layman's terms. The course material itself is quite straightforward, plug-and-play in just about every way and requires more regurgitation skill rather than critical thinking (making the exam open book made the course disgustingly easy).\n\nThere are no surprises in this class - everything on the exam will have been discussed in enough detail in either the lecture videos or homework. If the question was ambiguous or flat-out wrong, the professor would personally review and clarify, even refunding lost points. \n\n5 homework assignments, each having a multiple choice section for a small portion of the grade and then a couple of self/peer reviewed sections having to do with the data analysis. Each one had a few weeks' worth of time to complete, so the timing was quite reasonable unless you procrastinated. 3 exams with the same format as the homework, just spanning additional subjects and 2.5 hours to complete. All reasonable, unless you had a bug in your code.\n\nOnly two drawbacks in this class - the material is incredibly dry and repetitive. There are 15 minute lectures for what could be explained at a high level in 3, but get drawn out and watched regardless (easily half of the week's workload would be taking notes). The key takeaways will be identified in the lecture through boxes (hard copies of the powerpoints screw with physical note-takers like myself, though).\n\nThe second drawback is the lack of statistical discipline by the professor at times. There has been some confusion when the professor uses terms that are not correct in a statistical sense (goodness-of-fit vs. predicting power) early in the course that screwed with lectures later in the course. During this semester, a couple of the videos could have been re-recorded due to some mistakes (I expect this to improve over the course of multiple iterations).\n\nAgain, overall a good course to learn a few powerful, easy-to-understand models and a fairly reasonable class in terms of workload to pair with a perhaps more workload intensive class.",

            "text": "Fantastic class - it's basically an intro to python with an emphasis on coding efficiently and coding for data sets. While its primary focus was more on the underlying mechanism of commonly-used packages in python, the course was nonetheless effective when getting students to think about what was required to succeed in the space.\n\nAs stated before, during the Spring 2018 semester there was a massive disconnect between the homework assignments and the exams. There were three exams, all of which were open-source barring collaboration with people (but open-google, short of posting your ask on stackoverflow). However, the exams consisted basically of 6 homework assignments for you to complete in as much detail as possible. Exam 1 (24 hour max) was quite reasonable as the first few homeworks were very easy and were more on the programming, but Exams 2 (24 hour max) and 3 (36 hour max) ended up being harder variants of the homework problems to be done in a shorter period of time. I still aced the class, but the exams were definitely marathons (Exam 1: 4-6 hours, Exam 2: 18 hours, Exam 3: 10 hours, but only did enough to get 80% since I'd already guaranteed my A). Future iterations of this course will probably see updated exam logistics.\n\nNonetheless, nobody said it would be easy, and all things considered it was a deep enough course to justify an intro to programming for data science at the graduate level. For this student at least, a lot was learned. \n\nBackground: Proficient in coding in other languages such as MATLAB, SQL, some other object oriented programming languages, took Regression/6501 prior to or during this course, strong calculus/linear algebra/diff eq background from engineering days.",

            "text": "This course is a great course for mid to late program students. The lecture videos are very well done and entertaining, getting the core lessons across in a digestible manner. Topics are split across different areas with technical names which I would summarize as local parallelization (OpenMP), remote parallelization (OpenMPI), and cache stuff.\n\nProjects are uniquely challenging in that correctly implementing code (IE successful sorting) will only get you partial credit - full credit requires performance goals (Either completion under a certain time or number of cache misses). I previously took IOS/AOS so I thought that would give me a leg up for projects but I still found myself scrambling to complete projects. I ended up getting full credit for all projects but it cost me - I spent ALL my free time writing code and reimplementing methods to try to get better scores.\n** MY MAJOR COMPLAINT - Though I scored full marks, other people got crazy performance gains as compared to my implementations. While the lectures and papers leading up to projects give hints as to methods to use, there aren't any official recaps to let you know what you should have done.\n\nExams are very difficult. I am not entirely sure the motivating philosophy behind them, but I suspect the goal is to \"elevate\" your understanding of course material. What I mean by this is that the questions ask you to provide algorithms/psuedocode for problems you have not seen before. When I took Advanced Operating Systems I shut myself in my room for two weeks to study material and came out with 90s - for this class I did the same and scored raw 40/50 on the exams. Curves bumped me up to passing grades (approx. 75 each) but it does make me wonder what the exact point is of making things so difficult.\n\nStill, it was a fun class. The TAs are great, Professor Vuduc is great, and you will learn a lot if you put in the effort.",

Yes, we do agree diagrams will help illustrate the ideas, but it shouldn't play such a large part in grading\n- The Projects are about solving RPM problems by building an AI Agent, it sounds like a real AI project, however from my personal experience, it feels like a normal programming assignment, the `Intelligence` part is not that much...\n\nFinal Exam Drama:\n- So the prof posted final exam paper, which is a writing assignment. After three days when many people have finished the paper, they found out that the solution to one question (Q3) is available online. They took that question done and posted another version of final exam paper, many people's efforts in that question are now in void.\n- The worst part occurred in grading Q2, Q2 is a perfect example to be solved using version space as per discussed in lecture videos, it could be solved using Incremental learning concept as well, they are largely interchangeable and there is no absolutely right or wrong. Students who use version spaces concept didn't get much credit, when being questioned, the prof's response is like below\n\n```\nBriefly, the original final examination contained a specific question on version spaces using the same data as for Q1 and Q2 in the current final exam. Given that we had a question on version spaces in the original final exam, it was clear that Q2 referred to Winston's method of incremental concept learning (and not version spaces).\n```\n- So the grading principle is, because the original problem Q3 is using version spaces, thus Q2 cannot use version spaces concept. That is indeed ridiculous as Q2 and Q3 are not related, and students taking the exam shouldn't guess which concept to use based on a question that has been deleted from the paper! *Disappointed and cannot understand what they are thinking.*",

Plus two open-book, open-internet exams. It was very manageable. To do well, one just needs to stick to this simple schedule.\n\nThe course is R-based, but it assumes no knowledge of R, spending the first couple of weeks teaching it. There is no need to learn it beforehand.\n\nThe first half of the course could be called \"Intro to working with data using R\", while the latter half could be called \"Intro to Machine Learning\". It's not clear to me why it spends so much time on machine learning topics, but it does, covering subjects such as linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization.\n\nInteracting with professor Joyner is a great pleasure - he's a fantastic teacher. On the other hand, the course seemed understaffed. I don't really mind the grading taking a little longer, but I think it's unfortunate that our inquiries about specific midterm questions were never fully addressed.\n\nOverall it's a solid course, especially for people new to the program.",

First, the material is difficult to learn and takes some time to fully understand. The book and lectures do a terrible job of explaining the material (the book is vague and the lectures focus primarily on mathematically proving the theorems behind the material rather than the testable material itself).    \n\nThe second part of the challenge in this course is the way the exams and homework are graded. The rubric calls on strict adherence to very specific terminology, formatting, and nitpicks minor details. This can be frustrating because even with a mastery of the material and after solving difficult questions, you may receive a substantial markdown for trivial \"omissions\" in your solution.\n\nAs you go through this course, I would encourage you to stick with it even if you're receiving poor grades. I did very poorly on the first two exams and still managed to pull through. The very first test is the trickiest... it gets a little bit easier after that. Grades are curved pretty significantly too. Worst case, at least you'll get to see all of the material before taking the class a second time, so you'll be better prepared the next round.\n\nKeys to success:    \n-Take this class by itself, it's really tough    \n-Practice problems from the text book and homework on a whiteboard or on paper over and over again.     \n-If you have time before the course starts, brush up on Dynamic Programming (DP)... it is the most heavily weighted topic that takes the most time to master.    \n-In regards to DP:  focus your efforts on variations of LIS, LCS, and Knapsack type problems... there's no need to get more complicated than that    \n-Pay very close attention to the details of the professor's solutions (such as HW solutions) and make your solutions follow his particular format and verbiage    \n-Don't blow off the project: it's free points... it only takes a couple days to tackle & it'll be in python most likely.    \n-Youtube videos with graphical depictions of the algorithms in action really help\n\nI wish you the very best of luck!!",

I generally enjoy math and also took an algos class on Coursera a couple years ago, and I thought the course was highly enjoyable and not too difficult. If you are in a similar boat, you probably won't have much trouble with this course. On the other hand, if this is your first exposure to algorithms, I would highly recommend priming yourself for this course by taking a free algos class first, or you may find this course to be a lot of work.\n\nAnother key to this class is simply to practice a lot. A lot of the homeworks and exams come down to figuring out ways to apply the algos to a novel problem, sort of like puzzles where the algos are the tools you have to work with. Once you are in this mindset, though, it's pretty fun thinking of ways to solve the problems.\n\nOne last note about this course is that the instructional staff is excellent. Compared to other courses I've taken, Dr. Vigoda is much more active on Piazza. Probably the second-most instructor participation of any course after SDP. Dr. Vigoda was very occasionally a bit snippy here and there, but I'd rather have massive presence with occasional errors than a total lack of presence which seems to be the norm (or at least the median) for OMSCS courses. There were also several TAs that were also active and helpful, more than any other class I've taken. Grading for all homeworks and exams took less than one week (though the project took over a month) which is critically important from a pedagogical standpoint, yet virtually unheard of in this program, so major kudos to the staff in this regards.",

I have to admit this was the first time I struggled in a course, and have been very mixed on what to write. If you have any significant milestones in life or at work during the semester you intend to take this course, then I don't recommend this class to you. If you are have a lot of free time available then proceed.\n\nIt was definitely the most difficult course I have ever taken. I did think the material was very useful, and came out better for having made it through. The assignments were pretty cool, and required a significant time to complete. Only complaint was that it was never clear what made the best/fastest approach. It would have been nice to see what others did to get better performance.\n\nThe exams were absolutely insane, and not in a good way. Like other reviews said it is about taking what you learned to the next level. Given an entire weekend you might be able to solve all problems given, but in two hours just try to maximize the points you can get. The only real saving grace to the exams are a significant curve. My first class in the program was CS-6505, and those exams were easy compared to this class.",

Course grades are curved or scaled after all of the test and project grades are in.\n\nThe part of this class that I really enjoyed was the projects. I've got a moderate amount of C/C++ experience: three or four classes in recent history plus some self-study. These really stretched my skills and helped me improve my ability with these languages. The final project (MapReduce) took me about twice as long as the first project. I was able to finish the first project with about two days of solid work (8-10 hours per day) and the final project with about four days. Your experience will vary.\n\nThere's one hint I wanted to add that I didn't see below: guess on the tests.

            "text": "### tl;dr\nChallenging & fun course. Great material. Course management: not great but not terrible.\n\n### Overall\nThis was my first semester in OMSCS. And my first college course in 20 or so years. I found the lectures pretty engaging overall. I had no experience with CV, no linear algebra since HS, limited experience with Python, numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras, so I learned a lot in this course. The problem sets were challenging. The specifications could have been clearer. I really struggled with the second problem set and wondered if I was cut out for the class. Then I discovered the Slack channel. Saved my life. Seeing how others approached the problem sets (and how they interpreted the sometimes vague, sometimes incorrect assignments) helped me not get too far into the weeds.\n\n### Problem sets\nA lot of the problem sets, at the heart of it, were translating formulas (and occasional algorithm flowcharts) to Python. Sometimes I understood the fundamentals, sometimes it was straight up transcription.\n\n### Course Management & Piazza\nPiazza was pretty much a dumpster fire. Hard to believe anyone would choose it as a tool. TAs were occasionally helpful, often terse. Lots of questions went unanswered. Trying to navigate Piazza made it not worth trying to get help. Prof. Essa was in absentia until the very end when people got upset. He was also disingenuous by suggesting he told TAs not to reply so students would help each other out. I'd have believed that if it wasn't offered as a *post-hoc* excuse. \n\n### Final project\nThe final project (I chose the CNN one) was very challenging. I learned a crap ton, even though my results were pretty much worthless. I thought I might have tanked it but ended up getting 100%. Probably because I documented it well in the paper. And because I did a lot of research up front and tried to base my approach on current research.\n\n### Exam\nExam was challenging but not terrible. Open book. Which was helpful. I spent a good half-day reviewing the lecture transcripts (helpfully put together by a fellow Slacker) and the lecture slides. Lots of `ctrl-f` of course. Managed to eke out a B on the final and a high B for the course. That included slacking for a week of vacation and getting a 61% on one of the problem sets.\n\n### Advice\n1. Make sure your linear algebra and calculus fundamentals are strong. It will help you truly understand the material.\n1. Make sure you have a pretty solid basis for numpy, especially how slicing and reshaping and such works. Lean on numpy vs. for loops.\n1. Spend a few hours at the start of the course getting a high level view of the history and current topics in CV.\n\n*note: my workload is based on actual measurements. I spent 171 hours on this course total including administrative work like registration, watching lectures, reading research papers, problem sets, peer review, final project, exam, time on Slack*",

This class was very active on Piazza and most of my general questions were asked and answered by other students. I did however have a specific code question and sent a private post to my assigned TA but received no response. \n\nThe first half of the course teaches the basics of R and how to model data. This was really helpful because I had no experience with R coming into this course. The second half of the course teaches a few machine learning techniques. I think this is a great course to take before you take the harder machine learning courses. \n\nThe homeworks in the first half of the course were very easy and fun because you get to play with R to create all kinds of visuals for the data. The homeworks in the second half took longer but I felt they were valuable lessons to learn machine learning if you haven't learned it already. There were 2 projects, both of which are not hard if you dedicate the time to do them. Project 1 took much longer than project 2, but project 2 builds off of project 1 and is easy if you did well on project 1 and were able to reuse some of the code. The exams were very easy if you watched the Udacity lectures and read the course readings. Exams are open book, notes, internet (the only thing not allowed is help from another person, chat boxes, etc). The instructor tried to stick very closely to the materials provided and gave us points back for materials on the exam that were not covered or phrased misleadingly. \n\nI think the grading was very lenient on all homeworks, projects, and exams.

            "text": "A few disclaimers: first, I took this class concurrently with KBAI, and this was my first semester in the OMSCS program so my view on the class has very little reference to other classes in the program; second, I did receive an 'A' in the course, so I'll try to not let that color my opinion of it; finally, reading past reviews indicates to me that this class has undergone a fairly large transformation in the past two semesters, be careful making expectations about the course from older reviews.\n\nNow for the review: \nOverall, the course was interesting and fun, and I feel I learned quite a bit. However, there were a few things that bothered me while I was taking the course, and I wanted to wait until it was 100% over to write them up to give others a fair warning about these aspects of the course:\n\nFirst, the open-note final exam did not feel like a good test of the things I had learned watching the lectures and doing the assignments throughout the semester. Another reviewer mentioned it felt like \"finding a needle in a haystack\", but I wanted to expand on this further. Some of the material on the exam did not come from any of the class material.   Most of the exam required finding keywords in PDFs, or a specific sentence mentioned in a lecture. Many of the questions relied on wordplay to attempt to fool the test taker (similar to the lab notebooks).\n\nSecond, the midterm, which I believe was indeed a fair assessment, should have included the grading rubric when it was released. A number of students wasted a lot of time on a portion of it that ultimately was worth much less than the other portions of the exam. Ultimately I believe this contributed to that assessment being the lowest grade overall for the class project-wise. \n\nThird, it appears reviews of the Above and Beyond portion of the assignments were mixed. You really need to attempt to do all of these if you want an 'A' in the course. Personally, I was not really a fan. I thought that while the Above and Beyond sections could produce very excellent work, grading of the sections was too subjective. These Above and Beyond sections count for about 4% of your overall grade, and getting more than half of these points seemed almost unfeasible sometimes. I understand the intention to make the course more fun and produce original pieces of work, but I think more guidelines need to be set for both the students and the graders about what qualifies as an appropriate Above and Beyond. \n\nI do not mean to dissuade others from taking this class. I really did enjoy it (doing the final project and seeing others' results was AMAZING, and all of the assignments were very well-made and fun to do). The TA's were extremely knowledgeable, active and helpful. And I've never felt so much pride in the work I've done for a class. Mostly, I just wanted to make the above writeup as a refresher to the reviews from previous semesters.\n\nP.S. Buy a tripod for your phone, and start the midterm early.",

            "text": "Similar to what a number of other posts have covered. But I would like to comment particularly on the use of Bonnie grading vs. unit tests. In numerous cases, the unit tests provided in the assignment passed only then to find that the same code failed on Bonnie. \n\nSo if you assumed you were good because supplied unit tests passed that would be a dangerous assumption, especially as you get toward the assignment submit date. What then makes matters worse is that when Bonnie fails a test the feedback is virtually useless in terms of knowing what is wrong. This is not to say that students should write additional unit tests - what I'm saying is that the unit tests provided in the assignment were dangerous in that they generated a false sense of confidence. \n\nSo overall a course that covers a lot of interesting content but as others have said there was too many topics covered in the course and it could be split into smaller courses. This would provide the ability for students to learn the material more thoroughly. \n\nThe TA support was mediocre. I realize that TA's have their own projects which take their time but when a student takes time to ask a well thought out question, replies from TA's like 'yes' and 'no' don't really cut it. That is if the overriding goal of OMSCS is to spread learning and knowledge about all these new topics.\n\n\n",

Probably, in part, due to the fact the professor changed from the the time the video content was created.  I thought a disproportional emphasis was put into UML versus SW architecture and design topics. Group project towards the end of the semester is interesting, but if you find yourself in a bad team you may be in trouble as the team project accounts for 20% of your entire grade. Also on grading, it took the teaching body a long time to grade assignments, which can be a problem as, since some of the assignments sort of build on each other, if you make mistakes on an early assignment, you may get penalized for the same mistake on a later assignment. However, grading seemed very reasonable and methodical overall. It was my first course on the program, and one I thought to be a good intro to it after the fact. Probably worth taking it, but don't expect much learning if you work as a SW engineer on your day job; however, as others already alluded to, it is a Graduate course and you get what you put in. ",

Either you seem to hate it or love it. I personally hated it. It's my first OMSCS course, so I have little to compare it to. \n\n<b>Pros:</b>\n<ul><li>The class is extremely easy. The first quarter of the class is basically an introduction to R and an overview of the difference between scatter-plots and box-plots. If you can't pull an A, or at least a B, a master's program may not be right for you at this time. </li>\n<li>Dr. Joyner does seem to care about his students and this program. While he seemed overwhelmed at times, you could tell that he cared and wanted everyone to succeed. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Cons: </b>\n<ul><li> The homework/assignments/exams are poorly written. This is especially true for both the midterm and final exam, which had quite a few questions that could have multiple answers depending on the interpretation of what was actually being asked. A few students started a mini Piazza \"revolt\" where they threatened to escalate issues with the class/midterm if their grievances weren't answered (ironically, they then learned that the person to escalate these issues to for OMSCS is Dr. Joyner).    </li>\n<li> There are a lot of helpful TAs, but they never seemed to be on the same page. There were multiple instances where I would get two very different answers to the same question from different TAs. For example, multiple TAs said on Piazza and Slack that homework had to be done in LaTeX to receive credit. However, when they posted \"exemplary homeworks\" one student had literally hand written his homework, taken pictures with his phone, and cut/pasted the images into a word document.</li>\n<li> The lectures are hilariously bad. It's like they were made in some dystopian future where everyone must speak in a monotone voice and ideas can only be expressed through Word 2010 clip art. More importantly, some of the required readings have massive errors. I was pretty disappointed that this course has been going on for multiple years, and this hasn't been fixed. I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out Dr. Lebanon's logistic regression proof, only to realize (about two hours in) that it's just wrong. </li></ul>\n\nOverall, if you want an easy A or want to learn R, take this class.

            "text": "I feel KBAI is a great course to begin OMSCS.  My background is in electrical engineering so my software development skills are limited compared to others working through their OMSCS degree.  This course provides the option to utilize either Python or Java to work through the three projects that build on each other throughout the semester in order to develop an AI agent that is able to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices problems.  I found the material extremely interesting.  It is a bit of a jump for those with limited software development experience translating the theoretical course material and applying it to the projects, but extremely manageable after dedicating the expected amount of time.  Three assignments must also be completed throughout the semester that are 1000-1500 word essays on various topics taught throughout the course.   The midterm and final exams are both take home essays that must be completed within one week and the expected word counts are 2000 and 3000 words respectively.  It is a very well run course and the TA's and professor are extremely active within Piazza.",

The poor jokes of the professors make it even worse. The 3 projects in this course are mostly based on academic papers, which you have to read and replicated without much help. The TAs were kind enough to help on few of the homeworks and projects. Extremely hard final. I did take this course after taking ML (scoring an A in it). Personally I learned more from ML4T than ML and RL combined. Though the content taught in this course is interesting, there is not much practical applications possible (not a popular field at the moment). It would be better to take BD4H instead of RL as it will give you some hands-on experience for working in the industry.",

            "text": "Personal background: This is my first semester and I paired with course with Computer Vision. I don't have formal CS educational background or software engineering working experience. I have been programming with Python for a year or so to prepare for the application of OMSCS. I have taken college maths classes (which I dont think is used in this course).\n\nAbout the class materials: The lectures are very interesting and well structured. Probably not wide/deep enough. But the research challenge arranged by the instructor provided good opportunities for self-exploration and learning from each other. It is a pity that I did not spend much time on it. The hardware challenge also seems very interesting. I am not a hardware person myself but the things classmates posts are really impressive. \n\nAbout the instructor: The instructor Jay is very nice and effective. He almost answered/hinted every question on piazza. In a few cases when I twisted my wording to hide my stupidity when asking questions, he seemed to understand my intention and hinted on my confusion directly. I really appreciate his efforts in running this class well.\n\nAbout the projects: Project 3 is challenging. There are too many details that can mess things up. I decided to give it up to get a B but the deadline was extended.  So I \"had to\" work on it for another week and eventually I scored 6 out of 10 test cases and managed to get a A. (I lost 4 points because my solution was not designed to deal with certain situations due to lack of energy).\n\nMy lesson from project 3 is\n\n1) you need to really understand what SLAM is doing exactly in each step (same for the other algorithms taught in the class) . Only after that you can correctly modify the implementation. It seems a lot of classmates claimed that there is bug in the SLAM code. But it did work, at least for some other classmates and me. \n\n2) read and participate in the discussions on piazza. I had to make numerous decisions for the project and I did not have the time/patient to try them out. For learning purposes I listed the pros and cons for my options but most of my decisions are based on the comments from the instructors and other classmates. Sometimes even 'typing' the question helped me figure out the answer immediately. I heard from the instructor that it is called \"Rubberduck debugging\".\n\nFirst class?\nIf you know python and know how to plan to \"solve a problem\" and execute your plan, I think you should be fine. For me, most of the difficulties of Project 3 in the first two weeks came from my messed up code and code structure, which made it very difficult to debug.",

            "text": "The course is a broad survey of ML & is a nice introduction to the topic. It covers to a decent depth all the 3 learning techniques (Supervised, Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning). The video lectures are very informal & at times highly entertaining. But one needs to be very attentive (& make good notes) since a lot of the questions from midterm & finals are based on the conversations between Prof. Isbell & Prof. Littman. The TA's are engaged and hold regular office hours. Prof Isbell is very active on Piazza & show tremendous patience to the almost repetitive & very annoying questions (some of them seem to simply not use the search feature before posting questions - this can be really painful for a large class like ML). The 4 assignments are meant to let the students do a detailed analysis based on the application of learning techniques, tuning hyper parameters etc on different datasets (of our choosing) & provide right justifications for all our choices. The feedback can be at times very detailed & some times not so thorough(depends on individual grading TA). It can be subjective but most of the time based on well defined rubric. Your analysis can be as independent & informal but cover what's expected. I managed to score pretty high on these (overall above 90%) with a couple of centuries. And this saved me some grace from what was nothing but disaster of a midterm...\nProf. Isbell makes it very clear(repeatedly) that he cares the least when it comes to code for all the analysis & the only thing that matters is good analysis. You can re-use existing code (cite references).\nThe exams are closed book, without any pen/paper etc and expects short concise answers. The idea is to test the understanding of the concepts on many of the topics covered in lectures.\nOverall a fantastic class & personally didn't find it as hard as advertised in discussion forums. ",

(So I was a bit surprised that now it is a course of ML specialization). Personally I like this aspect more. There are a lot of smart ideas which inspire my ways of thinking. \n\nLinear algebra (a rough idea about what's happening) and numpy skills (vectorized operation) will help you with this course. And Be patient.\n\nRegarding the comment below that \"He openly stated he told TAs not to help students with questions\", I think the professor means(and he did say) that he encourages discussions instead of feeding you answers directly. My observation is that if I ask \"will I be punished if I use this function in my assignment\", TA will answer it very fast. But if I ask \"is algorithm A/parameter A better than algorithm B/parameter B for this assignment/project\", usually I will not get an answer from the TAs directly (but usually this issue has been discussed somewhere else in the post). I understand it might be a pain if you are rushing to a deadline but I think it's fair for effective learning. I learnt a lot by discussing problems with other classmates. But of course it would be better if TA/professor can give some conclusion remarks on some of the discussions. \n\nOverall after taking the course I respect computer vision more as a science.  I am glad the course is not designed to be an opencv or tensorflow tutorial.",

I tried to take this course over a year ago and ended up dropping it because I could not keep up.  This time around I prepared a couple months in advance by reading through Learn C the hard way and completing all of the C courses on Lynda.  \n\nUse the class Slack channel.  The TA's for this class are amazing and will always help you.  They don't give you answers but they can point you down the right path.  We had other students in the class with experience in some of the areas and they helped out in Piazza and in the Slack channel as well. Between the projects, TA's, and other students, there is a huge wealth of knowledge to gain in this class.  Then add on the papers and lectures and its almost too much.  \n\nThe TA's were very active on Piazza as well.  The instructor held weekly office hours to answer any questions about the projects, lectures, papers, or tests.\n\nProject 1 is really not that bad if you keep it simple, which is harder then it sounds when you're new to this subject.  Its easy to over think the problem and create a mess but the project is really pretty straight forward.  One of the main focuses of the project is multi threading.\n\nProject 2 was extra credit for us.  It had no programming but was a written assignment to design an experiment.\n\nProject 3 was the toughest.  It was a bit more free form in that you could design your program to work many different ways.  Its best to plan this project out before you start programming it.  I jumped right into programming and that was a mistake.  I still did very well on the project but I could have saved myself many hours if i would have designed before programming.  Shared memory and multi threading are some focuses here.\n\nProject 4 was the easiest.  Again its really straight forward but I can see it being another project that is easy to over think and make difficult for yourself.  This one dealt with RPC and multi threading.\n\nI found the mid term and final to be the most difficult part of the class.  You have to read all of the papers and watch all of the lectures and really understand the material in order to do well on the exams.  \n\nI stayed within the class average for the mid term and did very very bad on the final.

You can also do all of the readings assigned and independent research and expand on the projects on your own and learn a lot more.  This class is the epitome of you get out of it what you put in.\n\nI really enjoyed the projects.  They are not heavy on the programming but more of puzzles.  Projects included C, Python, Javascript, and reading PHP.  You only need to do very basic tasks in these languages and you don't need a deep knowledge in any of them.\n\nI even enjoyed reading through the book and I can't really say that about any other class.  I must like the subject matter. :)  \n\nThe exams are not difficult if you watch the lectures and do the readings.  The exams are very similar to the quizzes you take weekly.

You might ace all the homeworks like me but they mean little (only 30% of your grade). The projects are worth the most (45%) and they take a LOOONG time to get right. First, it takes a long time to understand how to implement them. Then you have to test them, which being machine learning, also takes a long time. Then once you know they work, you need to run them for long periods of time to get the results you need for the analysis. Please don't wait. The analysis isn't bad for each project (only 5 pages each) but obviously you want your code to work properly first. I hate the fact that they didn't release them all at once. I really would have liked working ahead. They only give you 2 weeks for each project and that's a shame. Overall, the course was incredibly interesting and well taught. The TA's were very responsive and helpful. This was a great class but of the 6 courses I've taken so far, this one penalizes you the most for waiting on projects. Just don't do it.",

            "text": "Great class. I had taken an undergraduate course in Operating Systems years ago, and this blew it out of the water in terms of depth and breadth. You'll get to learn about some low level, classical OS material and get into more modern ideas supporting concurrency, virtualization and distributed systems. Some of the lectures are pretty dense, so you'll probably want to watch them in pieces rather than all at once. There were 3 projects and an extra credit project this semester, and they were all in C. If you don't know C already, this is where the bulk of your difficulty in the class will come from. Some of the code templates given used syntax and operators I'd never seen before, and this created a lot of difficulty for me. If you're well versed in C and navigating Linux man pages already, you're probably fine. Exams were tricky, but I didn't find them exceptionally hard despite their reputation. The course is curved, and the boundaries seemed pretty generous. If you mess up more than one project you can still walk away with a B if your exam scores are above average. \n\nTAs are pretty responsive on Piazza, but don't rely on them to help you at the last minute - ask early and you should be good. Project grades take a long time to return, but this semester had an unusually high number of students so I kind of expected this going in. Make sure to pass Bonnie tests - they seem highly correlated with the end grade of your projects. \n\nThere was also a very active course Slack this semester where you can get fast help if the TAs are online. Professor Gavrilovska holds office hours every week (not just the TAs), so you can get help there too. I'd recommend this course early if you're looking into the Computing Systems specialization and need to brush up on low level OS material, but be warned - it's a deceptive amount of work. Definitely worth taking.",

            "text": "So, this class was pretty hard for me. I had next to zero algorithms background, but the topic is everywhere in CS and I wanted to fill in a lot of knowledge gaps by taking a supposedly-more-practical-than-CCA algorithms class, and I got it here. There were 3 exams and a final, 1 project, and homework. Exams were about the same level of difficulty as the homework, so the best advice I could give is to practice doing problems a lot, especially with Dynamic Programming and NP-completeness reductions. If you want an A in this class, you will work for it - exams are regularly 4/5 problems worth 25/20% each, so if you mess one up, there goes your grade. \n\nTAs are really responsive, and the lectures are very well done. I found them exceptionally clear if you pay attention, and more straightforward than textbooks in terms of the explanations on average, but not always (compared to Dasgupta and CLRS). The class was exceptionally well run, and this was probably the biggest factor in my passing at all - homework and exam solutions (though not the final exam) were released the day after the submission window was closed, so you can figure out where the differences were, and learn from your mistakes immediately. There were office hours all the time, though I didn't attend them regularly. \n\nIf you're wondering whether or not to take this, I'm going to recommend it highly. It's hard and time consuming, but it'll enhance your experience in other courses. For example: my section of Reinforcement Learning used Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming throughout the semester, and my (admittedly old) Computer Networks section had a Bellman-Ford project. All of these topics are covered in depth in GA, and will probably be significantly easier with prior exposure to them. It's hard to get in because all but one degree specializations currently require it, but keep at it and you'll be glad you did.",

Significant delays in grading led to lots of stress and churn within the forums.\n\nIf you specialty is not ML and you're merely curious about the topic take either AI (as much rigor but significantly better run) or ML4T (softer introduction to the concepts).

            "text": "Wow! This class is rough. It is written up as a survey class in AI but I'd say some of the work is probably harder than alot of specialized classes in specific subjects similar. I went in knowing little about AI and came out knowing a bunch of algorithms but not to much on how to put it all together.\n\nThe videos: well done and think it was smart to use others lectures when appropriate to explain concepts. Sometimes someone else explained it quite good, why reinvent the wheel and like this design in the lectures. However, especially when Thad was teaching, there were somewhat of a very light explanation of really complicated subject matter not well explained. Thad is clearly very intelligent and sometimes takes for granted the intelligence or former knowledge of his audience.\n\nThe book: You are expected to read this whole gargantuan book. It is dense and really really hard to follow. The algorithms given in book are in most cases better explained elsewhere, for example in the authors own videos. I learned multiple concepts better by watching videos elsewhere then I ever did this book. My eyes glazed over when I looked at it many times and found watching youtube videos on concepts way more productive.\n\nThe projects: Time consuming and difficult. All the projects came with unit test which many times did a horrible job of actually testing your code. This also led you in a false sense of security especially when Bonnie submissions were limited. Bonnie submissions on some projects were unlimited but limited on others. Also, the feedback from Bonnie was usually unhelpful. Many times you were being forced to write a complicated algorithm from scratch even though the algorithm existed elsewhere. You would write it and it would seem to work with the crappy unit test you had. However, Bonnie wouldn't like it and you would be stuck with WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG HERE? You would spin your wheels for hours and hours trying to find a bug with no idea what was wrong. Again, you are implementing an algorithm you didn't write and purely in math form that was really complicated. If your are unfamiliar with the math symbols, etc, it could get you. And so you would have 8 lines of code where there was a bug but sometimes you just couldn't figure it out. Now here is the other problem. For some reason there were a number of people who did really well on the projects. So, he grades based on median being an A and 1 stddev being a B. However, the median would most times end up being a 100%. So, good luck with that. Note, the median is done at the end of class so the test bring down the medians to a nicer range, but it can be quite frustrating to learn that your 95% or 90% on a project is a B. Dropping the last one is also done in the median calculation so it actually makes the standard deviation get smaller.\n\nThe test: Ridiculous. You are given a week and are take home. They are so much calculation and so easy to make a simple calculation error. The midterm took me around 40 hours and the final around 60 hours. I took three days off work for the final otherwise I wouldn't have been able to complete. It is really dumb too, cause it doesn't test ones ability to understand the concept but rather one's ability to do the math by hand. I ended up purchasing a scientific calculator as you have to have it to do the math. The other dumb thing is the test is open book but the internet is off limits. This means you can't use easier to follow explanations of an algorithm on spots like Wikipedia you had to use the confusing books explanations. This is another reason you had to use a calculator alot to do things like log10(x**(y/t)). And you would lose half credit for rounding incorrectly to the 6 decimal point. Test became about doing complicated calculations rather than understanding concepts and I found to be the most useless part of this class. Note, I got B's on the midterm and final median was 78.65% and 67.8%. \n\nThe TAs: Overall pretty helpful but many times refused to help on certain things I believe as ordered by the Prof. Also, no help during test and had a now work on weekend policy which was super annoying since everything was due on Sunday. Never seen that rule before.\n\nOverall, the class is educational but don't think I could carry it into a good understanding of how to use AI in the world. I wish there was less focus on the math and more on the ideas which is what I thought a survey class would do. Maybe I should have taken ML which is I think more about the ideas and what they mean. I spend way more hours on this class then in any other I have taken previously yet my grade doesn't reflect that. So, take the class but know what you are in for. Be prepared to make sure your job isn't going to have any overnight emergencies or anything. There were many who didn't struggle as much as I did so ymmv but and I did go in very green. However, I have gone into other classes green and didn't struggle like I did in this one.\n\n",

First of all this is a graduate course, some topics on computer science are vague and does not have formal algorithms or proofs to learn from, this is one such course. You will apply your computer science skills on this course, so like others mentioned here lecture videos are shallow, skimmed through and covered lot of topics.  If you are research oriented, curious to dig through then this course is for you.  Its overwhelming to do 10 quizzes, 1 final and 5 projects. If you are new to security you will spend lot of time like me but in the end you will feel that you learned something from projects.  Initially i had to juggle 3 courses, so i ended up blowing up on 1 assignment which had a big impact on my grades. TAs were very comfortable on regrade requests and did their best. It appears that materials have changed from past semesters, so if you are new to computer security and expect to learn from course videos and apply it to projects, you are not going to like this course. Its true that professor did not show up but i doubt that it would have made any difference due to the nature of the course. If you have hacking mindset and willing to dig through and learn on your own then you will enjoy this course. Don't assume this course is going to be easy, be prepared to put in solid effort if you care for good grade.

I found myself getting stuck for hours on stupid stuff, instead of spending my time struggling with the real content.  The auto grader was rather scary because you literally had no idea if what you submitted would work or not.  If this is going to be used, there has to be a system where we can verify our submission. The weekly quizzes were too easy compared to content and had little to do with projects.  But, if you learn by doing in projects, this is a good course. ",

            "text": "This was my first course in OMSCS. Initially I was apprehensive about R and linear algebra and calculus (last time I did that was 17 yrs ago). For learning R, the course provides sufficient time to learn the language and I also heavily used the DataCamp “Data Analyst with R” track and it made the homework’s and projects a breeze. To tackle algebra and calculus, I referred to Khan Academy. Both these resources are more than sufficient to prepare for the course. \n\n The homework’s, projects and activates are announced up front so that we can plan about them. Make sure you do all the activities since they are extra credits and help if one of the homework or project does not go well. The grading is lenient and it is not difficult to score an A. I think this is a great course to take first up in the program.",

If they use the same style projects and you can make it through the first two you'll be fine.\n\nMidterm was tough and the final was a whole different beast.  Both were long take homes and open \"any course materials\" (nothing else allowed).  However clarifications on questions came throughout the week the assignment was open.

They are fun and interesting. \n\nThere is a lot of reading required for this course but I I think it can be avoided since the book is dry and strangely organized. You'll need to reference the text to complete the quizzes. For the exams, I found that skimming the text for information and then intense flashcard memorization before the test to be a successful strategy. \n\nI liked the structure and presentation of the video lectures. I thought they were organized well and did a great job of distilling relevant information from the text. \n\nFor me the weak point of the class was in terms of the leadership and administration of the course. There were some outstanding TAs in this course, who were generally available to guide students on projects and the concepts underlying them. However, when it came to matters of policy and offering a cohesive message on things that came up, particularly in terms of graded content, there was no unified voice, and sometimes questions would go unanswered. \nThere were some minor snags endured because the course switched from TSquare to Canvas but those were teeny and inconsequential. However, a few times, things that should not have mattered turned into frustrating issues because no one would address them.  This was my fifth course in the program, and I'm not convinced that this frustration is rooted in an unreasonable expectation of course organization and leadership. These courses can't entirely run themselves. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I took this course and would recommend it to anyone who is curious about the topic and has had no exposure to it otherwise. ",

            "text": "This was a great survey course that tends towards the theory side without heavy math (but there is a lot of math, so define 'heavy' as being relative), but it took a whole lot of work. It's very easy to spend 20-30 hours on each project assignment. Study hard for each exam, and definitely reach Mitchell's textbook in addition to the supplemental material (you can skim papers, but make sure you understand them). If you have pre-canned code to run, this can greatly reduce your assignment time. I found myself writing a lot of my own code, so perhaps I could have saved countless hours if I knew which experiment to run beforehand.\n\nML is a very fair course, and they grade harshly per assignment and exam but do curve up. If you do better than the mean, you'll probably get an A. I screwed up the first assignment because I underestimated the time it took and sent it half complete (no extensions). I did at mean or better afterwards on everything, and it all worked out. They will be reasonable if you do poorly on the first assignment, but demonstrate an upward trajectory afterward.\n\nI took ML and ML4T at the same time, which had some overlap, but I found myself spending every weekend alternating between the two classes. I'd recommend taking ML alone if you're also working full time on a demanding job. I did get A's in both, but I also lost nearly every weekend for 3+ months.",

            "text": "This was my final class of the program and I am now officially finished with grad school (yay!) and this is without a doubt the most time consuming/challenging class I took in the whole program.  To compare it against even the 2nd most challenging class is a huge difference and to be honest this is probably the difficulty level all classes should be for this program.\n\nIf you are taking this class you really need to mentally prepare yourself for the time consuming workload that lays ahead of you.   The class gives you no time to breathe.  Even from day one you need to watch all of the lectures and get started on the first assignment which is due in 3 weeks.  After that you have 3 weeks until the next one is due, then you have 2 weeks until the midterm.  This pattern repeats all the way to the end.  You will never have a week off.\n\nThe assignments are not difficult to code, but very time consuming.  This is because the lectures go over the theory and math behind the algorithms and its up to you to figure out how to actually code them (using libraries.)  One positive is that you can actually steal code.  Yes, you heard that right.  You can Google someone else's code and use it if you want.  I know many people just used the code some previous students created for the class and this is perfectly fine.  I actually coded all 4 assignments myself and learned a lot.\n\nThe biggest problem with this class as others on here have mentioned is you have no idea how well you are doing or if you are even going to pass the class.  Until final grades came out I thought I was going to get a C and was prepared to take the class over again.  I did well on all four assignments (82, 79, 92, 90) which were all above the class mean, but completely bombed the midterm and final (34, 49) and somehow managed to get an A with the huge curve.\n\nIf you are going to take this class, get as much knowledge about ML as you can by pre-watching the class lectures on Udacity, or take one of the many ML courses such as the Andrew NG ML class from Stanford.\n\nOverall this class was great.  It was a ton of work but I learned a lot and will be continuing to study ML and will possibly be thinking about a career change to go into this field.",

            "text": "Great first course for OMSCS. After taking the course, I have a much better understanding of regression and the basics of machine learning as well as a pretty solid foundation in R.\n\nI have an undergrad degree in CS from 10 years ago and haven't coded much since then, and I found it fairly straightforward to keep up. The homework assignments and projects were fairly time consuming for me because I didn't know R at all, but they were interesting and I learned a lot. Some weeks I spent 10-15 hours, other weeks I spent 0 because there was only a small extra credit assignment due. I found it fairly easy to get an A.\n\nI watched the lectures religiously early on, but later on I found the class discussions and google to be much more helpful. The TAs were helpful, but honestly I found the other students to be the most helpful. The professor was more of a manager of the TAs than a professor, but that's fine.\n\nI was intimated by the requirements of linear algebra and calculus since I am many years removed from college, but it didn't turn out to be that bad. One assignment requires you to do partial derivatives to come up with the equation you need to implement, but it wasn't too bad to fumble through with the help of Piazza. The other assignments did not require much deep math knowledge.\n\n",

You could spend upwards of 6+ hours every week to really grasp the weekly lectures. There are 6 bi-weekly projects which can easily eat up your time. So you may end up paying more attention to the lectures related to the project and skim the rest. The project implementation goes hand in hand with the lectures. Everything you need are in those wonderful Bobick lectures. Aaron Bobick's lectures are great. He keeps the topics engaging and breaks it down into understandable segments. The project topics covered a range from basics of image processing, hough transforms, homography, motion tracking, optical flow, classification, detection,etc.. One topic that was genuinely missing was deep learning methods like CNN, R-CNN (supervised learning SVM is part of the course). \n\nYou have 5 choices for your final project. This is seriously time intensive (depending on your topic). There is a CNN topic for the final project which gives you chance to dive right in on your own. I loved it however it would have been nice to have some of the concepts being part of the course. \n\nCons: The professor(Essa) was no where to be seen till week 8 or 9 after which he made a cameo appearance. All the lecture topics are slightly out dated. The TAs and their responses were mostly binary however there was a very active Slack group which kept my spirits up. ",

            "text": "BLUF: This course is intro to Python and it goes really well with ISYE 6501. \n\nMy biggest qualm with the course was the length of the midterms. For my class, our 2 midterms each took an average of upwards of 15 hours (we got 24 hours, but it was still quite absurd). Surprisingly, the final only took me 6, even though we got 36 hours to complete it. The exams and homeworks were open book/note with no online proctoring. The only restriction was that we couldn't ask our classmates for help, so I must say that despite my complaint, I can't really say anything was unfair. \n\nI took the course together with ISYE 6501 (Introduction to analytics modeling) and it was kind of neat because we would code up a lot of the algorithms discussed in the modeling course. \n\nThis course is comprised of lectures and Jupyter notebooks. Lectures are well designed as well as homeworks (You get 1 per week and each one took me a few hours to complete with the tv running in the background, nothing crazy). As far as autograders go, I've had much worse experiences than the one in this course. Learning to debug is extremely important, and you will certainly gain some experience in this course. \n\nIn terms of course content, this is what I imagine is taught at the Python 101 level,  with a sprinkle of harder topics. Many of the weeks went something like: \"Here is an analytics technique/algorithm. Code it in Python. Python already has a built-in function for it, this is how that call goes...\" This is actually a pretty good way to learn, because you essentially teach yourself the way that some of Python's functions work by coding them manually thus giving yourself a good introduction to Python, programming in general and the analytics models.",

It would have made a lot of difference if the prof and/or TAs could use office hours to augment the video content with current day relevance, or expand on difficult topics etc. Because of lack of their involvement, the experience was not very different from watching yet another MOOC video. \n\nAssignments - There were 6 - barring a couple, most very fairly hard. Success in this course is just a function of time you put in. Sometimes I had to watch the same lecture more than 5 times to spot what mistake I may have made in the implementation.\n\nFinal Project - Very time consuming, but it is the only time you can work on a non-cartoon problem and get exposure to industry standard problems and solutions\n\nPeers - Very very helpful. I survived a couple of assignments thanks to many of their suggestions. \n\nOverall, if you are interested in the subject, you must take it. It does a very good job at introducing you to the fundamentals.

The class was pretty basic, with the exception of homework #3 which was very calculus heavy (which I have no experience with) and there wasn't much explanation for the math needed. For the rest of the class it was very easy, mostly just homework assignments where you had to shuffle data into different formats and then use libraries to display the data.\n\nOne frustrating aspect was that homework assignments were not graded in a timely manner. They often took 3-6 weeks to be graded. Part of the problem was that several TAs had accidents or unplanned events happen and so other semesters of this class may not experience such a long delay.\n\nI also wish that there had been more helpful feedback on assignments, usually they just marked the number of points you missed with a short comment to what section was wrong, but the comments were usually very cryptic.\n\nDr. Joyner was very kind when you approached him with grading questions and there were several times when an assignment would be awarded points because there were several students that missed a single question or because something wasn't very clear.\n\nOn average I spent 7 hours and 48 minutes per week, but there were some weeks where I did a lot more than others and the range is from 1:20 to 16:41 (that was one of the project 2 weeks).\n\nI would recommend studying calculus (which is does mention on the course info page) before homework 3, but other than that this was a pretty easy class.",

The professor is completely disengaged and unfortunately, the main TA this year was pretty rude and unforgiving to a lot of people who asked questions on Piazza. I would rate this course a Very Hard in terms of understanding what is actually expected of you, but Easy in terms of actual content.\n\nHonestly, the assignments were not challenging as long as you read every single Piazza post, even if there were dozens. Because I did not do that and just did the assignments as outlined on the assignment description (generally taking around 10 hours for each assignment), without fail, I would receive anywhere from 50-70% on every assignment, and then be forced to request a regrade and claw back points. Every regrade gave me 20+ points, so they are definitely worth it, but it is an absolutely ridiculous process if you think about the effort TAs have to put in to basically grade everything twice because they were not explicit in the assignment instructions the first time or their autograder was just wrong. \n\nYou would think since this class is so poorly managed, that you would be allowed to ask clarifying questions on Piazza, but after one TA repeatedly responded in a downright rude manner to anyone's innocent questions, I decided to forgo that strategy and just rely on the obnoxious regrading requests to get an accurate grade.\n\nAlso don't expect the final to be any less vague or subjective than the quizzes you do all semester. It had many typos, many ambiguous or contentious answers, and was hands-down the worst final I have taken at OMSCS (disclaimer: I have only taken 3 other finals).

I pulled one allnighter for this course because I am a champion at procrastinating, and even then, I could have just used one of the two 48-hour late day passes everyone is given. I even bombed one of the first assignments and ended up with a 97% in the class with all the extra credit they give out towards the end.\n\nI test much better than my actual understanding, so I found the tests fun and engaging and both the midterm and final had a generous curve (60%->90% and 76%->100% in my case). I would recommend going over the textbook somewhat thoroughly, or at least know where the relevant sections are, since on both tests, I managed to basically transfer pseudocode from the book onto the test for an entire question. Also have the solution manual to the book handy (there's a bunch of pdfs online). On the midterm, one of the questions was almost identical to the last year's midterm solutions. \n\nIf you're worried about taking this class, just take it and stay engaged on Slack and Piazza. Since it's usually a smaller class, all the students are very helpful and the professor and TAs were phenomenal. I started some projects 2-3 days before they were due (spending about 4-7 hours a day on it) and did fine by utilizing other people's questions and answers on Piazza and Slack. I don't recommend that because every single time, I would start an assignment and panic that I wouldn't crack the algorithm in time, but you should not panic if life gets ahead of you a bit and you neglect this class for a week or two.

You can work ahead, as all project descriptions and legacy code are available on the class website, BUT, the projects may change slightly closer to release so keep that in mind when you work ahead. **DO NOT** wait until projects are finalized before you start working on them, despite the chance some slight tweaks may be made to projects up to the week before it is due, start them as soon as you can. This is especially true with all of the projects starting from and including *assess_learners*. \n\nI would suggest making sure your *marketsim* project works perfectly when you get there. The most time consuming projects are *assess_learners*, *manual_strategy* and *strategy_learner*, with the latter two using your *marketsim* code, so make sure to allocate enough time to work on these when you get there. Also, for *manual_strategy* you will have to do some research into stock price indicators, and this project is used as a comparison for *strategy_learner* so it's good to choose these indicators wisely based on this research.\n\nThere are two proctored exams,  one mid-term and one non-cumulative final exam. Questions aren't difficult as long as you review all of the material, watch all of the required additional videos (e.g., The Big Short), and go over the practice questions/previous term exams where possible.\n\nAll-in-all, the material is interesting, the projects are overall well-structured and utilize the material conveyed in lecture, and often even have instructional videos to help guide you through some of the more involved projects.  TAs were responsive and easy to reach on PIazza, though Dr. Balch is often very helpful he can be a bit curt.",

            "text": "This is a very well-structured class. The material is very interesting and presented very clearly, and all course material is available at the outset of the course. There are *3 assignments*, *a 3-stage class project*, and *peer-reviews* for all assignments and project stages.\n\n**Assignments**:The 3 assignments are essentially essays that ask you to leverage class material to either a specific topic or a topic of your choosing (depending on the assignment). You often have a choice between which material you wish to discuss, so as long as you illustrate you understood those topics and provide a reasonable answer to solve the posed problem it's not too difficult. I would recommend using lots of figures, since the word limit can sometimes be tight, so flowcharts, pseudocode and illustrations in general are very helpful. Make sure to answer all rubric questions provided for each assignment.\n\n**Projects**:The class project is broken into 3 stages. The main overall class project is to develop an AI agent that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices, a standardized test of intelligence. I say main project since they also allow you the option to complete an alternate project for projects 2 and 3, which involves developing an AI agent chatbot that can answer questions based on answers from an FAQ. At each stage, you deal with progressively harder requirements / problem sets, and you will need to also write a project reflection describing your approach, what you learned and how it connects to KBAI topics. Start projects early, so you don't feel overwhelmed trying to rush things last minute. Don't neglect the written reflection too, as it's normally 40-50% of each project, and make sure to again follow the project rubric to make sure you answer all questions on each rubric.\n\n**Exams**:There are 2 take-home examinations, which aren't too difficult. They are essay-based, much like the rest of the course aside from project implementations, and you  have a week to complete each exam.\n\n**Peer Review**:You will also need to complete peer review for all assignments, all 3 project reflections, and the mid-term and final exams. They don't want single sentence sort of peer reviews, so you will have to put a bit of effort into leaving some good feedback here.\n\n**TAs**: TAs and the prof were all very active on Piazza. There were a few grading hiccups towards the end of this semester, but they were rapid in addressing these issues and correcting mistakes where necessary. I believe the prof, Dr. Goel, is stepping down and there will be a new prof so I'm not so sure if the exact structure of the course will be as described above, so take these notes with a grain of salt.\n\n**Prep**: This is a good first class, but if you aren't comfortable with Python or Java then you should get brush up on one of these prior to starting the class. Most people use Python, and if you want to complete the alternate Chatbot project, it is **only Python**.  Prepare for a lot of writing, as in total I wrote about 11-13k words across all assignments, project reflections, and exams.",

            "text": "One of the courses with the most genuinely involved instructors. They are actually around all the time and are still experimenting with and improving the course even though this is one of the oldest courses in the program. Professor Goel is going to stop teaching this course starting next semester, but it will still be taught by Professor Joyner (and Bobbie Eicher), so you can still expect a lot of instructor involvement. The course does open book exams without proctortrack, which is personally my favorite mode of doing exams since proctortrack is so constraining. Decent amount of freedom to explore and experiment in the assignments if that's what you want to do.\n\nMy main issue (and it is a big one) is that the material itself feels pretty dated: knowledge-based AI isn't really in fashion in our age of ML and deep learning, so I took this course to see if there was still interesting techniques in that domain, and frankly I don't think I've been convinced: there is *a lot* of material in this course, but much of it seems obvious, brittle, or excessively vague. Also there seems to be a lot of repetition in the material, where techniques that are extremely similar get presented separately due to what I think are very minor differences.\n\nIn summary: this is a well-taught course. It does require you to write a lot but you don't need to be a genius to get an A, just do your work consistently. However, don't expect your mind to be blown by the material, and be aware that you are learning about an area of AI that is now fairly outdated.",

If you know little about ML and/or python, this is probably a good first class to take in the program, but if you do you are likely to be bored by the programming aspects.\n\nThe finance part was OK. I started out as a believer in the efficient market hypothesis (which basically says that you can't profit by doing ML for trading, and therefore that the material in this class should be essentially useless), and I like having been exposed to the perspective of a professor who obviously disagrees with it. I'm still not 100% convinced, but this was an interesting experience.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me was that the midterm was almost exactly the same as one of the sample midterms that was made available to us for reviewing. In other words, we were given the answers to the midterm beforehand... As someone who wants to be challenged, I find this very disappointing.",

Technically for the assignments you can just edit the LaTeX but for the exams you do have to scan your filled out template while being filmed by ProctorTrack... Weird.\n\nAlso be aware that there are **a lot** of exams (3 \"midterms\" and 1 final) and that the assignments and projects count for very little (5% for the assignments, 15% for the project).\n\nOne criticism however: especially at the beginning of the class, I ended up needing to do a lot of regrade requests for my assignments and first exam which I felt were graded incorrectly harshly. Out of 4 regrade requests I did, 3 got accepted, which shows that there was indeed some excessively zealous grading going on. Things got better as the class went on, but if you take this class, do check your feedback carefully and don't hesitate to request regrades if something seems way wrong.",

At least they should try to be honorable and stop the blatant cheating: Pls. remove the term \"for Analytics\" from \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\".\n\nIn short, try not to take this course and apply for waiver.

            "text": "This was my second OMSCS course and by far one of the best courses I've taken at a university level.  I say best in term of the rich amount of material that's covered in the lectures and projects which further reinforce (THREE projects + 1 extra credit project offered but optional) the theory.  The class will require you to work very hard to complete the projects.  They give you starter code and a description of what's expected.  You will find yourself googling how to do things like setting up TCP sockets or using Shared Memory IPC etc.  A good background in C will help in this course as all the projects require using C language.  Slack and Piazza are good places to look for answers / ask when you are stuck; 7/10 times someone else has already asked the question.\n\nTo prepare for C, read and practice some examples on Arrays, Pointers (understand pointer arithmetic also), Structures, Function Pointers (used to do Callbacks), Dynamic memory allocation and freeing using malloc() and free().\n\nUbuntu operating system is used for the projects.  I used Virtual Box to run Ubuntu but perhaps my computer is sluggish and the VM was annoyingly sluggish.  I would recommend running it natively off of a partition if you can.   I have two monitors but could only use 1 with VirtualBox, I could look into enabling the 2nd monitor but I didn't even try considering how sluggish it already was.\n\nThe exams were challenging but fair.  If you go through all the lectures and understand the content and do the quiz examples and sample exam, you will be prepared for the exam.  It is a lot of content so do keep pace with the schedule while working on the projects.  I got through the class without buying the recommended books.\n\nThe course will get challenging and you might lose hope at times but keep going.  Here are sample scores from a previous semester and what grades it translated to with the curve.  I wish I had this information earlier in the semester:\n\nExample 1: Project 1 - 80 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 70%, Project 4 - 75%, Midterm - 90%, Final - 85% --> 87%, Participation - 5% (max) = A\n\nExample 2: Project 1 - 60 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 45%, Project 4 - 50%, Midterm - 80%, Final - 75%, Participation - 2% --> 65% = B\n\nProfessor Ada is passionate about this course and going above and beyond to help students.  She holds a weekly session going over project and class questions.  This was very helpful.  I did not pay much attention to this till half way through the semester.  It really does help understand the project requirements.  The TA's are also helpful in answering question in Piazza and Slack.\n\nIt was a lot of work but I'm glad I took this class.  It really makes you appreciate what the Operating System does behind the scene.  Even if you don't do Systems level programming in your career, you will have a stronger foundation in computing.  Best of luck if you take this class!",

            "text": "This was my first course in OMSCS, and although this class is known to be difficult, I found it to be very valuable and enjoyed Prof Kishore's enthusiasm. I had very little experience coding in C++, and I had never coded in C before. The first two projects were in C, while the last two projects were in C++. I put it in a lot of hours into this class, trying to learn C/C++ as well as trying to succeed on the projects. Because of the extra effort, I did really well on the projects.<br>\nMy favorite projects were Project 2 (C) and Project 4 (C++). For Project 2, we had to use the libvirt API to create a CPU scheduler and memory coordinator to manage virtual machines with varying resource usage. For Project 4, we had to create an implementation of the MapReduce using gRPC - this was the biggest project in the class and was also the final one. They gave us 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks to finish it, and I think I spent 3 weeks total on the project.<br>\nI found the exams to be difficult because you basically had to memorize a lot of information. This class covered several different operating systems and algorithms that were developed decades ago. Old midterms and finals were already on T-Square, so if you had to time to go through all of the old tests and skim through the research papers, then you would do fine on the tests. I definitely preferred the projects over the exams though.<br>\nThe class is curved at the end though, so as long as you start on the projects early and score really high on them, and not completely bomb the tests, you can get an A in the class.",

Many people are initially turned off by the open-ended nature of the class, but that's really the genius of it - to encourage intellectual exploration that would otherwise not happen if a clear and concise rubric was given to be followed.\n\nI had completed ML4T and RL previously, and those really helped with the course - particularly in understanding the grading style of the projects and with the RL parts of the course. Though having done only ML4T would have been more than sufficient for a successful experience in ML.\n\nStart on the projects on the day that they are assigned, and attending office hours, are key to succeeding in the projects. The exams are difficult and require a depth and breadth of understanding the material - there's no getting cute around that.\n\nOverall, an excellent class that is well designed and the student definitely gets as much as he puts into the class.\n",

            "text": "First things first: This was a course with an attached \"easy\" label\"; I'd say this is a course with a reasonable difficulty, **but I wouldn't categorize it as easy**. You'll need to study quite a bit and do a lot of research if you want to succeed, and most of that you'll do alone (books and resources are not provided).\n\nThe course lessons consist in video lectures from Udacity, and a textbook. They may overlap, but not necessarility.\n\nGrading is based on four take-home projects - which are just slightly related to what you see in lectures, ten open-book quizzes, and two closed-everything, one-hour proctored exams.\n\nThe projects are nice, and they'll force you to learn quite a bit on various security topics, but be aware: **most of the time you'll be on your own**. TAs will provide very limited help, and the professor is nowhere to be seen.\n\nAlso, sometimes you'll encounter badly worded, contradictory or plain wrong questions or requirements, be it in projects, exams, or quizzes: **try asking for clarifications, but don't expect proper answers**. Most of the times you'll be ignored. This is not so bad as it seems, because such questions are not a lot; but it can be frustrating if your final score is around a threshold for a grade. My suggestion is: **ignore them and go on**, you may think that spending time in \"fighting\" those will let you recover some points, but that won't work. Just go on.\n\nGeneral recommendations:\n* try achieving a 100% score in open-book quizzes. Their total value is the same as the two exams, so spend a bit of time on those, and take your time to crawl the textbook and the lessons for the proper answers.\n* start working early on projects, so you can ask on Piazza and Slack if you've got problems. **I recommend using textbooks** about the various topics, sometimes online resources are vague and make you waste time.\n* For the exams, **you must study all the lessons and the relevant chapters in the textbook**. Try understanding the underlying concept, but be advised that, without a good amount of luck, you won't get perfect scores there; some questions in the exams are overwhelmingly specific and you won't be able to answer them - but if you do well in projects and quizzes, an A is totally feasible. I wouldn't waste too much time on \"great exams\".\n\n\n",

They are essentially Prof Serban standing in front of a camera reading slides for an entire semester. Many of the questions on the quizzes/midterms/etc seemed to be open for interpretation and were debated extensively on Piazza. Many of the multiple choice & T/F questions were also very focused on technical theory (i.e \"what is the sampling distribution of the prediction of future responses under the Poisson regression model\") , which is fine for Stats majors, but for OMSA, I will not be retaining this level of detail. The examples were great and the R code provided with the examples gave a great starting point for HWs/Exams. For me, the workload was pretty light. It was essentially 1 week watching videos, 1 week HW, 1 week peer review... repeat 5x & mix in midterms/final. I averaged maybe 4 hours a week and finished with B+. Also- office hours w/ Prof Serban were @ 4 ET- they were recorded, but with only 1-2 students showing up, they were not very useful. I did learn a great deal about regression, but just did not feel engaged by this format.",

The exams were take-home and open-book, which allows you to use the exam as a way to learn additional material you would not have otherwise. (You'll notice other reviewers think this is a bad thing, but I think it's actually a positive that we get to learn things during the exam.) The pace of the six projects and two exams allow for no breathing.\n\nI mostly did not read the textbook and instead relied on the lectures. Many students complained the lectures were high-level, but I appreciated this since they focused on conceptual understanding. There are many online links to get more detailed information for completing assignments.\n\nI found the TA answers to questions mostly unhelpful. Everything you need to complete assignments ultimately comes up on Slack or Piazza though.\n\nI would highly recommend taking this class though I am glad I didn't pair it with another.",

The material covered is good but 95% of the learning must be done outside the class to complete the assignments. The assignment/projects are long (~15 hours/week for elite programmers, ~40 for average programmers), cover key AI topics that are often hidden behind black box python packages, and are heavily structured. This is both good and bad as the assignments act more like cookie cutter puzzles cut off of a completed project that you must fill in with your own pieces. Nothing is worse than trying to decipher someone else's code and figure out their intent. This is somewhat solved by an offline testing suite but it is often limited to the most basic things. The class definitely has the feeling of being more interested in making money than teaching students. It's a better class if you prefer independent learning and showing off your superior knowledge and skills to the professor.\n\nGrade Received: B",

Prof. Vuduc has a good sense of humor!\n2. Some parts are interesting, How do you parallelize a seemingly serial algorithm. I liked Unit 1 especially.\n3. Initial labs were really interesting. (Basically lab1 & lab2, lab3 was okay).\n4. Generous marking.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. It's a time sink. The lectures only give you really basic intro - with hundreds of external references, which you may have to read to actually understand the material.\n2. Not much interaction with Prof. Vuduc. The course was mostly driven by TAs.\n3. More theory oriented than needs to be & heavily tilted towards MPI scheme of things (which is really niche).\n4. No mention of CUDA & related stuff. Not even basic NUMA which are becoming commonplace. So this course has limited practical utility.\n\nMisc:\n1. The last 2 labs were about Terasort & Funnelsort. Really ? I came to this course for learning parallel algorithms, not yet another sorting algorithm.\nAnd don't get me started on Deepthought :-(\n2. OpenMPI is really niche, and unless you work in an area that uses it, no point banging your head for it.\n3.

            "text": "This was my first OMSCS course. I come from a mechanical engineering background, with only done 1 C project over a year ago during my senior year embedded computing class and capstone project. I've done some self-studying and programming at work, so not completely disconnected from the programming world. \n\nI knew that I would struggle a bit to understand and relearn C so I gave myself extra time to do the projects (START EARLY) and stay consistent with a strict schedule. With a full time job and no kids, this class was my life for these few months.\n\nOne key thing I struggled with in the beginning was to set up your environment. They say there are a bunch of ways to do it and you can do it however you would like, but from a beginner's perspective and not knowing anything about how to set up an environment, I would have appreciated it if they had ONE default suggestion. After a week or two of struggling to get a proper environment set up, I finally found a working environment. I used VM VirtualBox to install Ubuntu (which they should have instructions/find instructions on internet), then for IDE in Ubuntu I used VisualStudio Code. This IDE was great because I figured out how to do debugging (there is a youtube video on debugging with VSC in Ubuntu), and you can debug with multiple VSC windows, essentially stepping through multiple interacting programs (debugging client AND server at the same time).\n\nA tip is to be active on the Slack channel. It can be difficult to keep up with all the activity going on, but if you put in the time and effort, you can sometimes gain some really helpful pointers and tips. That is why it is recommended to really start early and find your problems/roadblocks early, and you can be on the lookout for a solution in the Slack channel. To get the most out of the Slack channel, I learned that you need to be very precise with the wording of your questions and try your best to communicate that through text. That will allow the TA's or students to better help  answer your questions. Don't be afraid to ask your questions, but be specific and think about how to phrase it in a way for other people to understand (explaining code and technical stuff through text can be very confusing and difficult).\n\nAnother tip is try to meet up with students locally. Having someone to talk to and discuss project ideas and course concepts is VERY helpful. Of course please beware of plagiarism and misconduct according to the course rules.\n\nProjects were absolutely great! Coming from someone with very little C programming experience, I had so much to gain. Of course they might change the project contents every semester, but our semester it was fair amount of work with the given time. The first project was the most daunting because everything was so foreign to me. The VM, which IDE to use, how to debug, socket programming (concepts I've never done nor was it taught in the videos); it was overwhelming at first... so START EARLY. Project 3 was by far the most fun (get a whiteboard) with the design aspect. Project 4 was the most difficult to wrap your head around, but once you figure it out, you will say: \"What that's it?...\"\n\nIf you finish the projects and pass all the automated tests with a decent readme, you should be able to get 100 on the projects. I did right at average for the midterm, and a little below average on the final (disappointed with my performance), but I surprisingly got an A in the course!\n\nAll in all, in my opinion this was a perfect first OMSCS course. It will definitely not be easy, but if you put the time and hard work in, you shall be rewarded!",

            "text": "*TLDR*: This is a graduate program, you are expected to work hard and work beyond what is provided to you. This course is an intro to ML/Data Science. Don't take it if you took ML already. \n\nThis was my first class at GT. I paired it along with KBAI. Although it's recommended to not take more than one class at a time, it wasn't my first time taking online classes, so I knew how to deal with the self-discipline of handling an online class. That being said:\n\nThe class wasn't difficult, but it was challenging. The first half of the course is a breeze (assuming you have programming experience and know basic statistics/visualizations). The second half of the course was more challenging, but it's where you learn. We implemented Logistic Regression from scratch, had to derive the cost function (partial derivative), and analyzed datasets, etc. The course serves more as an intro to Data Science as it covers visualizing data, cleaning data, modeling data, and deriving conclusions from data, overall making you think like a Data Scientist. I don't have a formal ML background (although I work in a Data Analytics team, so I'm exposed to it), so a lot of this material was not new for me. I do believe this is a good intro to ML/Data Science. \n\nOn another note, you will have to do independent studying to handle the 2nd half of the course. Prof Lebanon is quite dry and personally it was very difficult to pay attention to his lectures. Also, I didn't enjoy his teaching style. I made good use of Andrew Ng's ML course in order to understand some of the topics discussed in the second half.\n\nHaving completed only one of the extra credit tasks (called Activities), I ended up with an A. Professor Joyner taking over is probably the best thing that could've happened to this class. \n\nOne annoying part of this class however was how unprepared some students seemed to have been for a graduate program of this caliber (this is one of the easier courses of the program). Piazza was almost unbearable with the amount of simplistic questions that could have either been figured out independently or by a simple google search. I understand lots of people don't come from a CS/Software Engineering background, but the amount of hand holding some people needed/expected was almost ridiculous.",

The interaction with TAs, Professor and fellow students on Piazza was one of the highlights. Much of the course centers around 3 projects that implement an AI agent to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. This semester there was an alternate project offered for projects 2 and 3 for a select number of students that implemented a chatbot. In hindsight I wish I had taken the opportunity. I believe the chatbot project will be offered to more students in future semesters. My only gripe is that we didn't have more project based work that allowed us to implement techniques learned later in the course. The Raven's projects really only implemented techniques learned in the first few weeks. Be prepared for a lot of writing. Also, you can put as much time as you want into this course so it is a little dangerous. The homeworks and projects are very open ended.",

            "text": "Overall this was a decent course.  The lectures were pretty weak in my opinion, some weeks it was just a TA giving you the answers to the homework.  The homework assignments were pretty solid and the format of using Jupyter notebooks was really nice.  \n\nThe worst part of the course were the exams.  They were quite lengthy and exhausting.  It felt like the homework didn't prepare you at all for the exam so there was a lot of trying to research and learn stuff during the exam which adds to the amount of time needed to complete it.  That said, the final was relatively easy compared to the midterms so that was nice.  One thing that I didn't figure out until the final that might have been helpful for the midterms: instead of spending an entire work day (8 hours) on the exam, work 4 hours one night, then go to sleep, work 4 hours the next day.  The only down side to this is that if you need all 24 hours to complete the exam, you waste some up front (note, the longest I spent on an exam was only 13 hours or so). ",

I did an economics minor during my undergrad, took a few other business courses, and work for an insurance company so perhaps that made the material seem a little more interesting and applicable to me.  A lot of the information about marketing and strategy is very helpful for understanding why the company I work for makes certain decisions.\n\nThe homework assignments seemed fairly easy and the most difficult exam questions would be very similar.  Some of the exam questions would be asked about small unimportant details, which was annoying, but each exam had an opportunity for extra credit so it seemed somewhat fair.   ",

The professor explained some concepts in the mid term office hours that absolutely helped me to better understand. He was great and patient and very precise and literal. I liked him a lot.\n\nThe exams were much tougher than I expected. I got a B on the midterm (just barely) and very low grade on the final. Really understanding type systems kept me from totally flunking the final. It was much harder than the midterm. \n\nFinal overall grade is curved. I ended-up with a solid B. I could have gotten an A if I had spent more time preparing for the final, but I was sort of cruising at this point as I knew no matter what I would probably get a B since I has aced all the projects and got a B on the midterm.\n\nGood luck if you take it.

Grading turnaround time also was quite remarkable. I would recommend it as a first course, or as a course that can be combined with a very heavy load course like ML or AOS. The professor is not very much involved, it was entirely managed by the TAs - but it was awesome - almost everyday there were office hours with a TA, sometimes even 2 slots per day - which was great, so I didn't have to wait too long for clarifications. The course had a very involved slack too - given the size of the class Piazza was cluttered  and hence slack played a very important role as the medium for communication. I felt that to get more from the class, the project difficulty level could be rigged up - as most of the projects took a day or 2, but were given a month's time to complete.

The projects use industry-standard compiler tools and algorithms, so you could easily apply the knowledge gained in this class elsewhere if you needed to.\n* You will (most likely) learn a LOT. It is impossible to make it through this class without deeply understanding the parts of the compiler you're supposed to implement (lexing, parsing, symbol table generation, semantic analysis, IR generation, register allocation, instruction selection), the abstractions used under the hood (regular languages, context-free languages, parse trees, attribute grammars, control flow graphs, SSA, live ranges, live webs, etc.).\n* The 4 written homeworks were relatively short, but very topical, and struck a good balance between reinforcing the practical things we had to know for the projects and complementing them with the theoretical things we learned in lectures.\n* When you're done, you'll be happy you took it (if you were able to make it).\n\n### Bad:\n* The professor is uninvolved, and the TAs run the show. However, at least my semester, the TAs were distinctly unhelpful.\n  * Answers on Piazza were vague; project descriptions were underspecified or flat out *wrong* (this is not an opinion - one of the requirements of the first project was provably impossible, and when I pointed this out to the TAs, they were unable to understand the issue, despite agreeing with me that it was impossible).\n  * It turns out that compilers are *extremely* detailed, and those details are really important; expect to spend a lot of time looking for clarifications that may or may not be provided. We had to just make arbitrary decisions on a lot of issues, and document those decisions in our writeup.\n* The 2 projects are both group projects (3 person teams), and you must have the same group for each project (since project 2 builds on project 1).\n  * The only allowed languages are Java and C++. Be very comfortable in at least one of them.\n  * The projects are both large enough that you can afford to have 1 slacker, but not 2.\n  * The projects are sizable enough (i.e. 10,000+ lines of code) that you will either learn/use good software engineering practices, or fail. Again, your group composition can make or break you.\n  * Both projects are \"green field\" projects, meaning there is no starter code, no push in the right direction. This is a double-edged sword because it forces you to think about the design you want, but it's definitely less forgiving than it could be.\n\nOverall, this class wouldn't be that hard, if it weren't for the projects (which I hope get reworked). The material is interesting, and it's useful to be able to imagine the internals of whatever compiler you happen to be using (e.g. for work) so you can structure your code to provoke certain optimizations.

I took this class first because I don't have a lot of computer science courses under my belt, this is a foundational course I think any good software developer should take, the reviews indicated this is a relatively low workload course (compared to, e.g., Machine Learning and the like), and I am good with Python (and this class uses Python).\n\nFirst, the good points. I feel like I learned a lot about principles of system design and why the Internet is designed the way it is. The projects were a good mix of \"implement this algorithm\", \"configure a virtual network\", and \"reproduce and analyze the results from this academic paper\". The last item, reproducing and analyzing an academic paper, was particularly nice because it exposed me to how computer science research is actually done, experience that I did not have. That said, reading the papers and writing the report did eat up a lot of time, especially compared to the actual programming portions of the projects (I am an experienced Python programmer, so this part was a breeze). None of the projects were group projects, so that is also a huge plus. The lectures were mostly engaging, with enthusiastic presenters.\n\nNow, some negatives. The tests were usually not well designed. There were three, and only the first seemed to do a good job asking interesting questions that required advanced thinking about the concepts; the other two were filled mostly with what seemed like arbitrary tidbits from the readings and lectures, and were sometimes ambiguously worded. Also, some of the projects' instructions were not clear and the TAs sometimes did a poor job with clarifications, resulting in more anxiety and confusion about the projects than should have been there. Lastly, the professor made approximately two appearances all semester, one of those being during finals week to assign three entire papers to read and respond to for extra credit, taking the place of \"weekly discussions\" we were promised throughout the semester. This was poor form, and someone complained that this violated GA Tech policy of not assigning other work during finals week, so we all got extra credit without the need to participate in discussion or read the papers. Fine, but why not just do the discussions as indicated on the syllabus?\n\nOverall, I was happy with the course. It was a good first course for OMSCS, and I feel like the positives outweigh the negatives, so I would take it again. And, although I perhaps put in more hours than others with a more relevant background, I found the time commitment very manageable, given I have a full-time, minimal other commitments, and was taking only this class. Also, I read all of the assigned papers in full, which maybe bumped up my hours compared to other reviewers here. Just start projects as soon as possible, and you'll be OK.",

This is the easiest course I've taken so far by a considerable margin. A little too easy.\n\nThe best part of this course was the interesting papers that we were assigned to read each week.\n\nLectures were okay. They covered a lot of ground, which was nice but often did so in a superficial manner. Exams also covered a lot of ground, but superficially.\n\nFor the most part, the assignments were poorly put together and most of the \"challenge\" in them was working around the parts that were broken or poorly specified. There was one exception. Project 2 was actually pretty interesting, and a reasonable challenge. I got my hopes up after it, thinking that it was representative of what was to come, but sadly, the assignment quality went down from there.\n\nThe professor left the TAs to fend for themselves for the most part. I think she posted in Piazza a handful of times the entire semester. From what I could tell, the TAs did the best they could, given the professor's absence.",

            "text": "My review is biased because I began the class with an excitement to learn about Deterministic Optimization. The material is often highly abstract, and the future rewards seem uncertain, as if the class was an experiment in reinforcement learning. Entering the class with a strong interest was helpful to push through the early math portion, stick with it. The course begins by focusing on core mathematical building blocks like linear algebra, set theory, and convexity. A good understanding of this material pays dividends when the class begins to introduce concepts like search spaces, second order cone programming, and simplex.\n\nThis class focuses on the math and reasoning behind basic optimization techniques. In my opinion, this is the most important thing to understand about optimization before moving on to other optimization topics. Some students in the class had hoped for more applications of optimization techniques to real-world problems. While there are numerous real-world examples explained in the videos, the time spent actually applying optimization to real-world problems in the homeworks and tests is minimal. The class also doesn't really delve into the computational side of optimization. To be fair, that would probably make a good follow up class. Simple fixes like providing vectorized homework solutions could help improve the class in this regard. \n\nOverall I enjoyed this class because I enjoyed the material. I plan on continuing to learn about optimization and this class provides a good foundation for future exploration through the search space. \n\n",

A nice variety of papers to read, and I found the lectures to be well designed / delivered, and quite cogent and lively. The tests were all single-answer / multiple-choice, and relatively straightforward, if you had boned up on the material. The projects were also quite manageable, given sufficient time; 2 and 3 were among the most challenging, but it's pretty smooth sailing after that front-loaded difficulty.\n\nIn the Spring 2018 iteration, the current Professor (Maria Konte) was more or less MIA until the latter third of the course, and even then they only made occasional, brief appearances. However, she was a very positive, clarifying presence whenever she did weigh in.\n\nThere were a number of TA's who were friendly and helpful, but from whom we heard little. A lot of that appeared to be due to the fact that the lead TA (Stacia Stokes) seemed not to be a big fan of delegation. Others have noted her propensity to run a tight ship, and that is true, but is not necessarily a positive if you don't like your grad school experience to be akin to being the lowest ranking seaman in the Navy. She publicly castigated / punished students she apparently considered to be overly creative / curious, or insufficiently enamored of her top-down approach, on a number of occasions (as she seems to conflate them with the lazy or unmotivated as being \"problem students\".) Left something of a bad taste in my mouth, but she did competently bring the enterprise to its prescribed destination, I suppose, so... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Caveat discipuler.",

The final 2 projects made me lose my mind. I worked 100+ hours on each one and got very low scores, after getting 100% on all previous assignments. It was extremely stressful. So be prepared for a fairly unbalanced course by working far ahead so you can devote 100% of the last 6-8 weeks on Projects 2 and 3.

To make matters worse, you are very dependent on the group that you are placed in for the group project, which is by far the largest assignment. If you wind up carrying the burden of the development work, it can really suck. Also, the group project doesn't carry nearly enough percentage of the grade to justify the time investment. I think the class could benefit from having a more general Java development project rather than something so Android-specific (with next to no Android background being given). The rest of the class is easy peasy. Pretty much a waste of time. From the get-go, the professor and TAs have an antagonistic relationship toward the class, not budging an inch on the Friday due dates. There is no purpose to the fact that they don't release assignments more than a week ahead of time.",

            "text": "This is an engineer's course where you understand the concepts and code it. There is some Math involved like conditional probability, Basic Geometry and linear algebra, Bayesian theory, Matrix Math and so on. A self driving car is extremely complex and you are learning from a self driving car pioneer Dr. Thrun which is very good. However you only learn the basics in this course and would barely scratch the surface. Having said that this course covers pretty much the heart of what is needed like Localization using Kalman filter and Particle filter, different search techniques like A*, PID control and SLAM. I found SLAM the toughest to understand and comprehend. This course has no reports or writing which is the best part. Its pure coding and the projects are all or nothing. It starts out pretty simple with the Runaway Robot and gets progressively harder as the course progresses. Project 3 : SLAM Warehouse is the toughest of all and unfortunately for the summer course this was excluded for obvious reasons. But I was glad I got to do the SLAM Problem set 6 which itself was challenging despite being an introduction to SLAM. A piece of advise is to start early on the projects and assignments as they are released very early. If you time and plan all the projects and assignments early enough, you will have a month for the final project3 and trust me, you would need all the time in the world for that. The drop deadline is pretty much useless for this course unless you screw up the earlier projects which is unlikely. The TAs for this course were the best I have encountered so far. Prof. Summet is very active on Piazza and super helpful. The office hours are recorded so there is little reason to watch it live. Being active on Piazza and the Slack channel is the key as you gain immensely from fellow students insights and advise. Overall an excellent course and the experience was very satisfying.",

            "text": "I am slightly surprised that so many people rate this class highly. It's kind of disappointing in many ways. The head TA on repeated occasions (I won't out them by name here) is condescending and frankly never helpful. Their responses to Piazza posts (and given the fact that they answer the majority of posts) actively discouraged me from ever engaging with Piazza because I was concerned about asking a question that felt \"stupid\" or simple.\n\nThe projects are probably the worst part about the course. Many of them are simple, quick assignments that can be completed in a few hours if you have some Java knowledge. However, the layout and structuring around the projects (and the individual project itself) is a nuisance. The major issue is the assignment time frame. I took the course in the summer term, so the full semesters may be different. Each assignment was released on a Saturday and then due the following Saturday (7 days). No exceptions or previews. This means that if you have something come up for work, another class, etc. then good luck. You still have the same time frame. Not all classes in OMSCS give info ahead of time about projects. But when you expect students to turnaround an assignment in a single 7 day time window, there should be some level of foresight given upfront so they can plan for things. I had multiple occasions where I had to rush and turn in a subpar assignment because on Monday morning my work commitments would pile up for the week and I was left to choose between slacking off at my job or skimping on a course assignment.\n\nThe second major issue with the projects is that they are structured in an order which can actually hurt you later. For example, there's a project around the 4th or 5th project that requires you to build a testing suite around a program that doesn't actually exist, and you aren't supposed to implement the program. However, in the individual project (which is 20% of the course grade), you are then expected to implement the program AND it must pass your test suite from weeks prior without making any changes to the test suite. This means that if you misunderstood a requirements, didn't plan for something, etc. in the earlier project, then you'd potentially harm yourself in the later assignment (as you may have incorrect test cases based on assumptions at that point that you aren't allowed to change). Why is this necessary? It just seems like poor planning for the course structure.\n\nThe final issue with the projects is that some of them simply feel watered down and unhelpful. The second part of the individual project involved the instructions saying that you had to change your program from part 1 because of \"updated customer requirements\". In the real world, this happens. But in a graduate level course, what justifies this as an assignment? It is hard to see how that part of the project is anything more than busy work.\n\nGrading is slow and obtuse. They have a ton of students and about 6-7 TAs. The rough math comes out to 40-50 students per TA, which is actually about average for many courses. I am a TA for a course that has an assignment of about 45 students per TA. In SDP, they don't release grades for weeks. 8 weeks into the course, they have only finished grades for the first 4 (out of about 10-12) assignments. There is only a week left in the official course. So, they are considerably slower at grading than other courses in OMSCS, and don't expect feedback about earlier parts of large assignments before you complete the later parts. They also don't give any details about the grading for projects, so don't expect to understand where your grade comes from until the release grades, either.\n\nFinally, the course material is fine. If you have any experience in software development, it is going to seem basic and boring. There's nothing new or novel covered in the course. In fact, I honestly would put the course on par with an undergraduate SE course. It's inoffensive, and there is a grade for completing the quizzes so they \"force\" you to go through the materials. There are no exams, however, so there's no pressure to actually pay attention and absorb the material (unless you don't have any SE background and the material is new to you). The projects only require a cursory knowledge of the week's lessons.",

The algorithms covered were used in several classes I took later; also after 6 semesters in this program, I feel like this course did the best job of meeting my expectations of what an on-line course *should* be.\n\nThe lectures are as entertaining as lectures get: full of lame jokes, puns and bad acting; the interaction between Thad and Shelly is engaging. When I took the course Thad was the head teacher and held office hours every week, and Shelly was the head TA, interacting with us on piazza. Having the lecturers involved in the course is rare, and pretty awesome judging from the other courses I've taken.\n\nWhen I took this course, assignments were submitted to an auto-grader, so I always knew what grade I was going to get and could correct my code up to the deadline (once you've taken a few courses, you'll understand the dread of waiting for the TA's to attempt to run your code and grade it on unforeseeable edge cases, in an environment that may not reflect what you expected).\n\nWe were only graded on the top 5 of the 6 assigned homeworks, which would be very convenient should you need to miss a couple weeks due to life issues or something. I did all the assignments, but I really wish other classes would follow this format as I've bombed assignments in other clasess due to work deadlines or other life events\n\nThere was a slight curve applied when I took the course; everyone above 85% got an A, which was convenient for me as I did not do to well on the two take home exams.",

And to think I was close to withdrawing before I saw that quote.\n\nThe format of assignments is great: very open ended, you use the algorithms recommended, pulled from any library you can find and write a paper based on your findings. I say the format is great, because for practical projects in the future, I'm not going to be writing SVMs or even Neural Nets, I'm going to be downloading the latest and greatest algorithms PHDs have released for me and applying them to my data sets. You also get to choose your own data sets! You can work on two applications that really interest you while completing your assignments! You will of course be graded brutally and told you made terrible choices in your analysis, choice of data sets and writing, but ignoring that fact, the assignments are really fun and instructive.\n\nDr. Isbell and Dr. Brown are a very entertaining duo and the lectures are very fun, though they are also thick with far more linear algebra than I was able, or will probably ever need, to comprehend. Dr. Isbell was the instructor while I took this course, and he was as entertaining on Piazza as would be expected  from his lectures.\n\nThis course was my first encounter with proctor track, which is a program I have learned to loathe: it decides to work perfectly for the practice tests, but as soon as you take a real test, it suddenly decides that your video drivers are insufficient and: surprise! Find a mirror far larger than anyone would have on hand to do a room scan. New suprise: * crash *! As far as the privacy / ethics concern, I think it's about as intrusive as a proctored test would be, and personally have no objections to it there.\n\nStart projects early, there were only 3 or 4 of them, but each will take 30+ hours if you're not familiar with the libraries and algorithms used; even if you were, you can not finish an entire project in the last weekend before the due date. Also, attempt to take the tests early, you may need hours of time working with proctor track tech support to get it running,.",

Also, it IS true that the course does not directly make the connections to analytics.  However, it provides a really solid framework to a lot of business topics that you need baseline information about in order to be effective.  My primary critique is that the material is not always laid out in the best possible way for students to make connections and really tie the information together into a cohesive whole.  Additionally, the sheer number of lectures is pretty painful to get through - if the material is optimized, it might not require so many.",

You will spend most of your time researching and learning the various internal and external APIs rather than programming anything cool. The code for the APIs are extremely messy and extremely difficult to work with in my opinion. Also, there are a limited number of submissions that can be made to Bonnie per day which makes it more difficult to test your programs.

There is heavy weighting and emphasis on quizzes which test your ability to search a PDF version of the text book and spot the \"Gotcha\" questions where they change one word in a direct quote from the book. The exams are a similar style. I was really excited for this class and was looking forward to getting exposure to information security. Now, at the end, this felt more like boring required courses from an undergraduate program. The weighting on the quizzes seems to be designed to \"force\" students to read and watch the lectures--which as a graduate student you should be doing anyway--but do not seem to be designed to enhance learning or reward students for being diligent. Overall, I would say unless you already have a background in Info-Sec--which would make the class trivial--or are looking to transition to security, avoid this class. It was a significant disappointment. \n\nThe one saving point for the course is the projects. They are not terribly difficult but you can learn a lot and a few are pretty fun too. Ultimately, I would say that if the quizzes were dropped and more projects and papers were substituted the class would be excellent and would become one of my favorites.

            "text": "I did not have any experience in C, and this was my first exposure to operating systems concepts. Prior to this class, I took ML, CV, AI, and RL. Prior to this class, I read through OSTEP and Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, to prepare.\n\n- The projects pushed me to ramp up my knowledge of C very quickly, and apply concepts learned in class.\n- The TAs were the most responsive I have ever seen, replying in less than half an hour in many cases.\n- Most useful feedback I have ever received on an assignment, for project 1.\n- Professor Ada was very involved. She knew the ins and outs of every assignment, and held weekly office hours. \n- Professor Ada and the TAs were transparent about why they weighted the exams and assignments the way they did, and how they graded. They were also understanding with regards to Bonnie issues, and the TAs helped us out with local testing. \n- Deadlines for the first two projects were extended.\n- It was a very collaborative environment. Students helped each other out with enthusiasm. The interop testing especially in Project 1 was very useful.\n- Resource recommendations were excellent: I will likely continue to refer to OSTEP, The Linux Programming Interface, and Beej's Guides in the future.\n- The instructors actively solicit feedback for every project, and this shows in the quality of the projects. The projects came with clear instructions in a readme, helpful tips, and no mistakes in the code. I liked that we were required to document our approach and think about ways to improve each assignment. This enhanced my understanding and retention of what I learned while doing the project.\n- I wish we could have gotten our grades and feedback for Project 2 before taking the final. Perhaps hiring more TAs would help, but maybe the class budget is constrained for summer semesters.\n- I also have difficulty learning from video, without an accompanying textbook. I was grateful for the class-compiled transcripts, but it was a bit hard to follow since it was just verbatim. I liked OSTEP and The Linux Programming Interface, but to do well on the exams, we really have to focus on what is presented in lecture. It is probably too much to ask, but it would be great if there was a guide (similar to Beej's, perhaps) for the course. Maybe I'm a rarity though, and most students learn perfectly well from videos.\n- It would have been nice to see our answers alongside the correct answers for the midterm, but that's not too important.\n- I didn't find the exam guides very useful --- I would have preferred more questions in the style similar to that of the actual exams. The quizzes and sample questions in udacity helped, but there were only so many of them, and I found the questions on the midterm and final to be much harder.\n- I found the papers very dry, took the advice of one previous reviewer, and didn't read them. The lectures cover the points that may be on the exam.\n\nOverall, I love this class and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.",

I learned a lot about how to take a high-level spec's and decompose them into the set of tables that best serve the application.\n\nHowever, the course feels incomplete. Efficiency and performance are quickly touched on as an after thought in the closing weeks of the course, and there is no hands-on work with significantly large scale data sets (as such, any performance aspects of the toy data sets are trivial). There is also no substantial coverage of concurrency and locking, or NOSQL systems. \n\nThe project was a good illustration of how to integrate a front-end web application with a database management system backed web server application. If you have never worked any web programming, the learning curve is pretty steep. I would recommend working through some online tutorials on database backed web application programming sooner, rather than later, if you do not have experience in this area. I worked many extra hours for a couple weeks because I did not have any experience in that area. We ended up using Flask and MySQL, which is probably a good fit for most OMSA students as we all have to know at least Python for the program. \n\nPlease also note this was summer term, so my hours are likely higher than during a fall/winter term due to the compressed schedule.

If you wanted to dig deeper and ask questions, he would make time to engage with you and discuss. However, the course assignments/lack of projects cause this course to be mostly an exercise in how well you can retain info from a video rather than using critical thinking. \n\nI did not experience an excessive amount of memorization that others have commented on. However, it may be that I just had an easier time remembering the different concepts from the videos.\n\nThe course did not require much time, which prevented it from being too frustrating.

Course structure wise, the project (ebay like project) itself is not so much related to course or at least it was far from what I was expecting from the course. I agree with so many other reviews this course is not at par with other Georgia tech offerings and is definitely not worth risking grade. I think this is the only course where Grade B% is more than Grade A%. Overall, if you want easy B then go for it. But knowledge wise you will not gain much from project. I already forgot most of the theory I learnt for exams so nothing much to gain there too.

The course provides a great overview and introduction to machine learning concepts, reinforcement learning and finance without diving into the weeds. But if you already have a introductory machine learning background this course likely won't provide much value to you. This would be a good course to pair with another course since the time commitment is not as large per week as some other courses. However, communication between the professor and TAs regarding finalization of projects and content covered on exams was severely lacking. In many instances official communications did not finalize the projects until a few day before they were due. Project descriptions from previous semesters were made available to us at the beginning of the course and luckily in many cases the descriptions changed minimally once the project was finalized. There was a midterm exam and a final exam administered via ProctorTrack. ",

            "text": "I loved this course. David Joyner is a great teacher who clearly cares a ton about the course. We had one solo project, 2 exams, and 10 homework assignments for the 12-week summer term. This is a little different from what is usual due to the compressed timeline. You can find a ton of information on the course website: http://omscs6750.gatech.edu/\n\nThe most important thing to know about the course is that it is all writing and zero coding. I was a philosophy major as an undergrad and had no issue with the writing, but others seemed to struggle. We were expected to write on 3-5 topics per assignment, and usually had a ~1500 word limit per assignment overall. In total, the most you were supposed to write for the assignments was 14,000 words, with a recommended length of 10,000 words. The project was another 2,000 words recommended, and you were capped at 2,400. If the idea of writing 17,000 words scares you, don’t take this class.\n\nThe exams were quite reasonable. The median grade clocked in at around 85% for both exams, and David gives an obscene amount of statistics and analysis on the tests. It was really cool to see.\n\nYour grade is 35% homework, 20% project, 35% tests, and 10% participation. You can get participation in a bunch of ways, such as Piazza, peer feedback, and completing surveys.\n\nOver the course of the course, you follow an entire design cycle in the homeworks. I found this to be a really rewarding experience from which I learned a lot. I also really appreciated the readings, which were quite interesting and not particularly long.\n\nI would say the course was medium-to-easy. I struggled with some serious health problems during the course and was force to take an incomplete as I couldn’t finish the project on time, but I found the assignments quite manageable and wouldn’t have had an issue if not for the health problems. That said, I was a philosophy major and so was much more comfortable with the writing than many of my classmates.\n\nI spent about 12 hours a week on the course, of which 7 was spent on homework + projects, 2 on lectures, and 3 on partipation and auxillery things like skimming the papers. I didn’t really read the papers until I was studying for the exam. There, I binge-read them all and then skimmed them during the tests (the tests were open notes).\n\nI get like it was a really good course to take over the summer, and it was a welcome break from\nHardcore coding (I had taken GIOS the previous term). I would definitely recommend taking it if you’re looking for a technically light course that will teach you interesting and somewhat off-beat things. There’s a solid chance some CS people won’t find all the psych stuff interesting, but if you’re generally into learning or think psychology is cool there’s a lot of nearby content to learn here.",

            "text": "I didn't enjoy this class.  I didn't enjoy comp networking in undergrad either so this is just a subject I dislike, I guess.  The material is very boring although some of the security stuff toward the end of the class was a little more interesting we didn't do much with it though.  The lectures are quite boring and I just tried to get through them as quickly as possible.  Tests were proctored and not to bad to study for.  There was a mid term and final. \n\nThere were 5 project in this summer session.  The first was using mininet and topology design.  The second was more topology design, switches, routers, etc.. and required some basic python programming.  The third was more of an experiment, run the tests and write about what you found.   The fourth was about firewalls and required basic python.  The fifth was about bgp and utilized mininet again.  For the projects its important to note that the way you submit them to canvas was different for every project.  Which I thought was very odd and cost you 15 points if you submitted it incorrectly.  They said it was because of the grading scripts.  I don't know if that is supposed to be a gotcha or just poor design.  Sometimes the file format you were supposed to submit were listed in a random piazza post by a student who had to ask about the format of the file submission.  Just pay close attention to that and make sure you ask if its not clear in the directions.  \n\nThere was 80 points of extra credit as well.  \n\nTA's were active on piazza and tried to answer questions there.  I don't recall the instructor ever really interacting other than at the very last week.   \n\nIf I could go back to the beginning of the summer I would have chosen a different class.  I don't recommend it unless you're gung-ho on comp networking.",

            "text": "As my first real ML course, it was a decent introduction to ML concepts, though I wish it had gone more in-depth into actual trading strategies. The pacing of the course feels a little off at times. You'll cover almost all of the Udacity lectures prior to the midterm and will be watching YouTube videos of live classroom-recorded lectures afterwards, which tend to drag on due to technical problems and other in-class reasons. \n\nWhile all assignments are posted on the wiki up front, we were warned they they were all subject to change and that they would be finalized at least two weeks prior to their deadline. This never happened and each was finalized just a few days before being due. Most assignments remained relatively unchanged, but the \"very challenging\" final project was finalized 5 days before it was due, and then changed again after being finalized to add a new section worth 15% of the grade. Needless to say, the instructor communication in this course was very poor. The TAs were great and grades were returned fastest of any of the 6 OMSCS courses I've taken, but it was obvious they had extremely limited say in how things were run. Professor Balch was MIA for most of the course, leading to a lot of unnecessary confusion on Piazza. Combined with the new \"Piazza participation\" metric worth 5% of our grade, Piazza was difficult to meaningfully follow.\n\nThe projects were fairly easy overall. Some have YouTube videos with the professor walking you through a solution, while another took literally a few minutes to complete. There were 2 fewer projects in the Summer semester, though a portion of one was built into the final project. Two of the projects required writing reports, though neither was very intimidating due to the rubric spelling out exactly what to include.\n\nThere were 2 ProctorTrack exams of about equal, moderate-to-easy difficulty, though the final did include a few questions about The Big Short movie that were completely inappropriate/unrelated to this graduate-level course material.\n\nThere were 3 books (1 required, 2 optional), but I didn't use any of them and had no problem getting As on every assignment and exam.\n\nOverall, an easy class even for summer, made mildly frustrating only due to the professor's lack of engagement in making simple clarifications and some students' lack of Piazza etiquette (exacerbated by the participation portion of our grade).\n\nCourse material is publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Machine_Learning_for_Trading_Course",

Piazza wasn't particularly active and most of the interaction was via Slack. This meant that a lot of questions about the projects were repeated, over and over, in the Slack channels, along with a wave of activity just before a project was due. \n\nThe workload was very manageable. This was a summer course, and compared to the workload in GIOS, this required about half the effort. \n\nThe textbook is atrocious, and is designed to cram as many standards and terminology into the printed pages as possible. The quizzes are verbatim from the book, so you'll need it to do well there. Lectures were much better. The first half of the course is by Professor Ahamad, who rambles a little bit, but sets a nice pace for taking notes. The second half is by Professor Lee, who moves very quickly, and you'll need to pause the video if taking written notes.\n\nThe projects were the better part of the course, and covered topics such as stack overflows, malware analysis, encryption and web security. Most of them don't take a lot of work, but you'll likely get stuck and need to walk away for a bit. Therefore, you really shouldn't leave them for the last minute.\n\nUltimately, it's a decent introduction to Info Sec for a software engineer. If you are looking to specialize in Information Security as a Security Engineer, you'll need to supplement this class with additional training.",

            "text": "On a week to week basis this class has the lightest workload of any class I have taken in OMSA, by a large margin.  The homework is so simplistic it's almost pointless.  To bring this class up to a similar content level of other OMSA courses you'd basically need to double the amount of content.  For example we spent four weeks of a ten week term covering linear regression and it could have easily been managed in two weeks.  This is a topic that has been covered in some form or fashion in three of the four other classes I have taken.  No one in this class should need this slow an introduction to this topic (this is an advanced core class after all).  The topics later in the semester, network analysis, text analytics and association mining were better but they were covered at a pretty superficial level to me.  This class would have been better if we dove into the details on these topics rather than spend so much time on a topic that everyone in this class should be fairly familiar with at this point (linear regression)\n\nThe homework assignments are not hard, but they do nothing to enhance your understanding of the content or prepare you for what is expected on the exam. Most of the homeworks are basically a reperformance of the sample code provided in lecture.  Almost zero thought or analysis is required.  \n\nI would have rated the difficulty as very easy if it hadn't been for the final exam.  The homework and sample exam questions did not prepare me for the level of detail demanded on the first part of the exam (50 multiple choice questions).  Given my performance on part 1 I made a better effort to prepare for part two of the exam.  I felt prepared for part two content wise but not prepared for the awful format. Exam questions in a pdf, answers placed in a word document and 30 questions almost all of them requiring coding resulted in a three hour frenzy of coding, alt-tabbing and copy and pasting.   \n\nThis was another disappointing class from the business school.  Based on my experiences in 6203 and 6754, I will be avoiding all other classes offered by the business school unless I see actual evidence of quality content being created.  This class just feels like another missed opportunity.    ",

I took this summer 2018.\n\n## Pros: \n- projects are pretty interesting and you learn a lot doing them\n- Quizzes are stupidly easy, but they play tricks with wording. \n- easy A if you have the time to figure out wtf they want from you\n\n\n## Cons: \n- the projects, while interesting, are terrible with defining requirements. Literally awful at it. You will spend so much time figuring out what the projects actually are asking you to do. It is insane how much time was wasted figuring out the project requirements.  \n- the quizzes I was talking about before are stupidly easy, but they are barely like the exam. There's no practice exam, and the quizzes don't help to study for the final.\n- The quizzes are written through a language barrier, which would be fine, but the problem is the questions also sometimes have careful tricks in their wording. This is going to sound confusing, but there will be a lot of times where you'll be wondering about what the question is really intending to convey so that you can answer it correctly. You'll know the concept it's asking about 90% of the time, but you'll get shot in the foot by wording if you're not careful. It's done to a degree that isn't constructive because each quiz might only have like 4-10 questions. \n- I frame busted my life dude. project 2 is terrible. seriously.\n- There were no office hours. I heard nothing about video conferences either. Totally absent on slack and piazza.\n- The TA's are very hard to reach. I only posted twice to them because I knew I wouldn't get an answer, and indeed I didn't. whack. Props to one TA William Lucas though for being quite helpful. And also props to the students who hashed out the requirements on Piazza with the TA's kicking and screaming.\n- I also took IIS before this with the same professor. Honestly I have yet to see any actual proof that Professor Lee actually exists. I'm pretty sure he's just a concept used to refer to a loose collective of overworked graduate students that are laundering money through the university for a professor's salary and trying to funnel it into their crappy startup idea preventing ridiculous FERPA violations from happening in American universities.

I find Wenke Lee's lectures to be very boring since he is just reading something word-for-word.\n\nQuizzes are pretty much pointless. The questions are taken straight from the book so they don't teach all that much. However, be sure to stay on top of the due dates because (at least in the summer) they can be a bit erratic.\n\nThe first project can be a bit challenging, but once you have that ah-ha moment it is pretty straightforward. Be prepared for writing reports for a few of the projects. The second project requires no programming but the first, third, and fourth projects require C, Python, and HTML/JavaScript, respectively.\n\nDon't expect the professor to make any appearances. Don't expect much from office hours since the TAs take turns running them, and most decide to have them on the Slack channel which I did not find useful since you couldn't post questions ahead of time and it was difficult to find the discussion later.\n\nI would reccomend this as a first course to take, a summer course, or as a course to pair with something more difficult.",

Professor used to have a session per week but due to mid-morning timings, it was not possible for many students to attend that session. Personally, I could attend only 1 such session. \nTo succeed in this course you need to spend upto 5 extra hrs on your research and study beyond the material provided.  \nCase studies and programs were provided in the course material which helped a lot for homeworks but again due to material quality and incorrectness, you need to make sure interpretations for those are valid. ( Mainly logistic and Poisson regressions chapters.)\nExams are okay and it is not very hard to get grade A in this course.\nIt would have been great if course provided more opportunities to work on more real life use cases than homework with 100 variables which was of no use.

            "text": "Course Modules - Many hours of video to watch. Make sure you get the information the first time or you will be watching it all over again preparing for the tests.\n\nTest - As long as you give it the college try and put in a solid effort (~1-2 day) study for each exam, it is reasonable to land an A. That doesn't change the fact that because the exams are 80% of total grade, they are pretty high stress running up to taking the test.\n\nAssignments - Pretty light workload. For the first half, there are only (3) assignments which will take 1-2 hours. Because the assignments count for 20% of your grade, you will spend more time checking your work 5 times over to insure you didn't make a silly mental error than actually doing the assignment. There are no assignments the second half of the course. One could theoretically just cram for the final for a couple days at the end and (maybe) end up fine, although that would be one hella weekend.\n\n\nFull disclosure: I received an A in the course and thought it was OK, material wise. Would have much rather taken a more analytical elective over this course, because...you know, MS Analytics. Therefore, if you have any remote academic knowledge in the business field, I would recommend you attempt to Opt out and replace with something else.\n",

            "text": "**Pros:**\n\nWell, it was a very light workload so I had a relaxing summer term (though, this isn't really a good thing because we are here to learn after all).  Explanations of different types of regression were clear and useful review.  Association rule mining was interesting and new to me. The interviews at the end briefly raised some important issues.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nOverall, such a missed opportunity from a content perspective. For a course about analytics in business, it was:\n\n * light on the analytics side: 75-80% was coverage of traditional regression models. The remainder was mostly very shallow coverage of association rules, text mining, and graph analysis.  No coverage of contemporary ML/AI/NLP. No coverage of visualizations/dashboards.\n * light on the business-issues side: nothing (except an interview at the end) on areas in different industries that are being transformed by analytics, value/customer orientation, analysis of internal projects as investments; and \n * light on the interconnections between analytics and business: little/no mention of the history of data analysis in business, data acquisition/silos/cleaning, cost/benefit of analytics projects, privacy and security issues, ethics, data lifecycle management/QA, prototyping and agile/lean project management, and operating analytics/ML products in a real setting.\n\nThe interviews at the end, though interesting, were bolted-on without any connection to the material or effective application.\n\nThis class should have been a historical and current overview of data issues from C-suite, VP, and project team levels, plus weekly hands-on case studies of _real analytics projects and problems in business_, with an industry expert brought in help guide each one. The course needs to be completely redesigned based on input from industry analytics leaders (such as those the prof interviewed).\n\nHomework was easy and boring -- basically rote tasks. Mostly type in a few lines of R (or hand-calculate), get some numbers, select the right multiple-choice option.\n\nThe final exam was bad. I don't know why the business school has such an irrational preference for rigid exams over applied projects.  Part 1 relied on memorization and had several poorly-constructed questions. Part 2 was just a 3-hour proctored slog of R coding and copy-pasting that I managed to finish and review with 2 minutes to spare.  High-stakes exams are an extremely poor way to teach most analytics topics --- projects/case-studies actually reflect the work of data scientists in the real world.",

            "text": "This was my 7th course in the program.  Taking this class in the summer is pretty relentless.  2 homework assignments and a project are released in 3 week intervals with the first 2 homework assignments due in the first 2 weeks and the project due the 3rd week of that interval. The homework assignments are autograded so you can see your grade immediately, and each one takes only 1-2 days to complete.  For all of the assignments/projects, you have to start with a blank slate (no skeleton code given).  Two of the projects were replicating research papers.  I would say the first project was not that exciting, but project 2 was the coolest project I have done in OMSCS so far. \n\nAbout half of the lectures were not very well done -- It feels like you are watching the professors nerd out instead of explaining the material.  They also assign multiple research papers to read in addition to the lectures that you have to watch every week.  I would say its not feasible in the summer to read all of those papers (24 in total), although some students were able to fit it in.  \n\nMiguel was a very helpful TA since he offered a few in depth help sessions in which he went through some of the assignments in detail.  However, outside of the help session and regular office hours, the TAs avoid helping that much with the assignments/projects and usually give you more research papers to refer to if you are confused.  I therefore recommend discussing on slack among your peers when you are in a bind.  \n\nDespite some of the flaws, the subject material is extremely interesting, and I am very glad I chose to take this course. 4/5  ",

Expect to come out of it able to understand and use the language of analytics,  but not with enough skill to really implement anything well.,  Assignments can be tricky,  not a lot of programming guidance is given unless you watch the programming office hours(which I recommend).  The tests are multiple choice style.  I think the challenge of the tests is pretty fair vs the rest of the material.  I only have two critical points,  the case study part of the class should be more practically oriented(actually doing the problems)  and the homeworks don't have enough weight on the grade(they take a ton of time and only count for 9%).

It is largely a rehash of 6501. Assume we know it, revisit it quickly and turn towards application of it in business. It felt like a whole week was spent on what was covered in 3 slides in 6501, without necessarily getting into greater depth. Spend more time on all subjects and their application to real world business examples.\n\nIt was a good opportunity to review Regression but spent way too long doing so, with easy homework - would have been better if the homework had been a bit harder like the exam.\n\n Wait to do this course after it is revamped (hopefully).

I won't re-iterate what was said in the previous reviews (its an overall good class), but I will offer some ways I think the class could improve.   I think this class should have two tracks - one for people that aren't sure what they want to do coming in, and those that are.  I feel like I did one or two too many papers, and it was a bit of a stretch sometimes trying to lead the papers towards the project I already had in my mind since the beginning of the semester.  Another small thing is that a lot of people are taking OMSCS while working full time (or more).  It is necessary to grade participation for peer feedback and surveys because they're central to the course, but grading participation in a forum (piazza) when you maybe only have an hour outside of work for free time is a bit of a downer.  Some people can't check this stuff constantly (and when checked, most topics already have good answers).  It feels like they're taking points away for something I can't help. Piazza participation will happen naturally, there's no need to force it on the students.  Another thing is that a lot of these projects varied incredibly greatly in quality. There were some very impressive projects, and others seemed like way less than 100 hours was spent on it (particularly the research track projects). Maybe you could rework those. Some of the papers I peer reviewed were poor quality as well- maybe this was handled in the grading as a matter of course. Sometimes it was a little frustrating to put a lot of effort into my papers and then read papers that seemed like they weren't up to Georgia Tech's quality bar.  Finally, the way the grading is done on the final projects for the development track encourages students to take a safe project (not a lot of effort) so that they have time to make a really polished presentation. It may discourage ambitious projects. This might not be what you're going for.",

I might call it a waste of time, but I only spent a couple hours a week on it, and this was in a condensed summer term (for a fall/spring term, it'd be way less). I could have completed this course in single weekend. The content in this course is very conceptually easy, mostly because the treatment of the material was exceptionally light. I don't feel as though I've learned anything about Data Analytics in Business, which is what you think you might learn in a class called Data Analytics in Business. You might think there would be business cases, simulations, team projects, ethics, consulting reports, etc. that would make the class interesting and fun... but I think they tried to avoid that. I was excited for this course, but left feeling disappointed, and I'm really not that difficult to please. There just isn't very much content in this course.\n\nThe exam format was stressful. The one test was the final, which was worth 50% of the overall grade. The questions on the first part of the final were very poorly worded, and I think about 10% of the grade on part one is completely random chance. The second part of the exam was much more straightforward, but took a whole 3 hours to do if you were going fast. \n\nIf you're taking multiple courses at the same time, pair this one with a difficult course. If you're a first-term student, don't base your opinion of other OMSA courses on this one. The ISYE and CSE courses are challenging and interesting.\n\nEDIT: I believe student criticisms have been heard, and they'll (hopefully) make some changes to the course in future terms.",

I was expected an emphasis on test techniques, but the course was more focused on the \"analysis\" than the \"test\".  However, the analysis has some important foundations that are used for testing (as well as compilers and IDEs), so all in all a good course.\n\nMost of the projects were fairly straight-forward, though some difficult to tell \"when you're done\". Only one was difficult, but that largely due to an unfamiliar language (Datalog).  A few of them had reports, but were fairly straight-forward.\n\nThe TAs were great, especially Chris. The projects often came with videos to get you started. The VM environment for the project(s) were stable and only had 1 minor missing component on one of the later projects. Thankfully, only 1 VM required for all the projects.\n\nMy only negative on the course were the exams. While sample questions/solutions were provided, the exams didn't reflect them very closely. The exams did expect deep understanding of the topics. In some cases, I felt the exams were more complex than the lectures or the labs.\n\nAll in all, glad I took the course...learned a lot I likely wouldn't have picked up anywhere else, and have already been able to use some of the concepts in \"the real world\".

            "text": "Just finished this course (Summer 2018).  For me personally, I expected it to be challenging going in as it was only my second course in the OMSCS program and I have no formal background in CS, or relevant work experience for that matter (I am an Officer in the U.S. Navy with a nuclear engineering background).  I did however, have a pretty solid background programming in C and Python, which proved useful.  The workload was manageable while also working full time.  The course was condensed (summer course), so it moved rather quickly.  It was not crazy difficult, but it was not easy.\n\nI found the course material very interesting.  The online lectures almost go hand in hand with the books and were mostly strait forward to follow.  If you are like me however, and have had no formal background in computer architecture (VLIW architecture specifically), assembly language, a good working knowledge of compilers (i'm talking under the hood of compilers), or C++, it can be a bit intimidating at first, but it is still very doable.  With a lot of reading and some external research, I was able to overcome the rather steep learning curve within the first few weeks.  \n\nThis course was broken up into three  major topics.  The first is a \"review\" of computer architecture, with the emphasis being on a VLIW design philosophy.  The second is a deep dive into compilers.  The third section focused on four different and unique compiler optimizations (specific to embedded systems) which is the main point of the class, and really the most interesting part.  The optimization portion was pretty thick with register allocation being one the most fundamental and key concepts to grasp along with lots of graphs and graph theory.\n\nFor the summer course we had four homework assignments, which required a bit of time and effort to complete.  For at lease two of the assignments, I had to write Python scripts to aid in executing some of the algorithms used, as doing them by hand was not practical.  Overall, if you go through the lectures and use the textbooks to supplement, the homework assignments are not bad, they just take a little time to complete.\n\nThe project was a group project, so you will need to partner up with others in the class.  The project was advertised as one project broken up into two parts, which were completely unrelated, so really its two separate projects, both done with the same groups.  The first project was quite the monster.  We effectively made our own scheduler, which was done in C++.  I had to learn C++ and do the project in parallel, so it took a bit of time.  Also, the project description as written was insufficient to do the project, and do it correctly.  This is really my first complaint about the class.  Once you start getting into the meat of the project, you will quickly discover that there is much more that has to actually get done then appears at first glance.  My recommendation is get the exact expectations from the TA's off the get go....for everything.  The second project requires the use of a Raspberry Pi board  which you will need to purchase if you don't already have one, and a little bit of C programming.  Again, had some issues with the project description and required lots of clarification from the TAs.  Also, to make things a little stressful, project due dates overlapped with due dates for HW assignments (by only a few days in both cases), so you really can't waste any time.\n\nThe projects also required the use of the Deepthought clusters at GaTech, which you will be given access to.  For me,  and just about the entire class, this worked for about one day after which, I lost access to and was never able to get on again.  If this happens to you, don't waste time while the TA's go through the hoops of submitted trouble tickets and figure the issue out.  My recommendation is to install and understand how to use Vagrant.  I was able to do the projects using the Ubuntu Trusty32 box which is made available and by using the Raspberry Pi board with Raspbian installed.\n\nThe final exam was the only exam for the class, and was not easy.  It was cumulative in nature and took a good bit of time for me to complete.\n\nLastly, second and really my main frustration for this course was the TA's.  Going into the final exam, Piazza at a glance looked something like 40 unread post, 17 unanswered questions, and 34 unresolved followups (actual stats).  Piazza was like a ghost town, and the TA's were the ghosts.  Usually 2-3 day turnaround time to get a question answered, and it was usually some vague one sentence answer which wasn't useful.  You will rely on your classmates in Piazza to be successful.  To be fair, the TA's were very reasonable with grades and everything was graded fairly.\n\nOverall, I actually did enjoy the class as I found the material quite fascinating.  I think the class would be easier if you went in well versed in C++, have taken a computer architecture course, and are comfortable with assembly language and assembly notation.  The class could be improved if the project descriptions were rewritten and the TA's were a bit more involved on Piazza.  If they fixed these issues, I think this class has the potential to be awesome.  Also, for someone with such little prerequisite knowledge, I did very well in the class. ",

It is both a horizon-broadening opportunity and a good introduction to machine learning. Projects are not not difficult if you have experience in Python. I took it in the shorter summer semester, but I did not feel the workload is heavy at all. Lectures are well made. Assignments are well defined and have a template to start with. I especially like the last two assignments in which I got exposure to reinforcement learning. \n\nIn general, I like this course. It is not that time consuming, but I actually have learnt stuff.",

The rules of the class are well thought out and very clear.\n\nI was able to get into the alternative project (doing a chatbot), and it was a great experience. The rules were not as clear as in the main project (because the project was still in the experimental stages - we were warned about that beforehand), but being a part of the group helping to define it was thrilling. \n\nOn the other hand, I didn't really care for the lectures. I felt the material was outdated and without much practical application (that's just my opinion - professor Goel would disagree).\n\nYou have to write a lot in this class (essays, not just software). I think it was a great introduction to OMSCS - after taking KBAI writing-assignments in other classes don't seem scary at all ;)",

TAs are great and active piazza/slack channels help to understand the course lot better than what is covered in the videos. Videos are, well, hard to grasp and not very much interesting and not well taught. I always wondered why the content should be so tough to understand and why can't it be taught in an easier and understandable way. Projects are good, though I did not like the reproducing paper's projects. Final is a little hard though they are T/F type. You need to really get the concepts to crack finals.

The schedule felt a little rushed however the subject was very interesting and well worth my time.\n\n** Structure **\n\n* 10 quizzes = 20% of grade\n    * Open book and can be taken many times while open.\n* 2 exams = 20% grade\n    * Closed book and proctored.\n* 4 projects = 60% grade\n    * Stack overflow attacks, malware analysis, cryptography, and web vulnerabilities.\n\n** Pros **\n\n* Covers plenty of topics in Information Security.\n* Information is up-to-date and relevant to the current market.\n* Projects are very interesting and provide *hands-on* experience.\n* Overall, the TAs did a very good job at managing the class. Questions and grades were answered/returned promptly.\n\n** Cons **\n\n* Quizzes feel like busy work as they are literally taken straight out of the book. It is highly recommended to purchase the suggested book.\n* Professors were completely absent from the class. Maybe they were on vacation?\n* The coverage of each topic can feel a little shallow, but given the amount of information that is covered I can understand why.\n\n** Conclusion **\n\nThis was a good summer course that complements Network Security (both classes are taught by professor Wenke Lee). Recommended as a summer course or introduction into OMSCS.",

Its recommended, although not necessary to have some background in ML.\n\nThe material is quite rigorous and covers all the theory, and is still kept quite interesting by the professors. Prof. Isbell and Littman, who teach the lectures, cover so much, and with such ease, that you'll wish they took all the classes. There is a lot of reading, that can be hard to keep up with, but some of the projects require you to implement those, and thus, you'll be forced to read some of the papers anyways. I did not consult any other material than the one already provided, and it worked just fine for me.\n\nThe homeworks and projects are fun, and challenging. You will get to learn a lot from them. Final is T/F based, and will test the concepts taught in the lectures.\n\nRL is one of the frontiers in the field of ML/AI and has tremendous applications from Robotics, to even understanding human decision making and game theory. I'd strongly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in all that.",

However, I was impressed at how fair the instructors were in responding to ambiguous questions.  The instructors gave us an extra 2 points for questions that were unclear (or not covered in class).\n\nPros:  \n- Extensive theory on the different types of normal forms.  You will get a very strong understanding of 1-3NF and BCNF.\n- Professor Leo Mark is hilarious too. His telephone book explanation of searches is friggin awesome!\n\nCons:\n- No prep time for learning PHP.\n- No mention of non-relationship databases (No-SQL). Example:  MongoDB, or MapR, etc.\n\nOverall a good class, but not trivial.  The group project near the end can be taxing. It is easy to make light of PHP.  It takes time to understand how it works if you are not familiar with it.  Make sure to give Phase 3 of the project enough time.  Rely on your group mates.  They will save you :)",

Too many readings made worse by a shorter schedule. \n\nI was initially very excited about the assignments but gradually became disillusioned. The grading made it feel like an exercise to hit all the questions without regard to actual content. There were assignments that I poured everything in and got disappointing grade because I missed some tiny details. On the other hands, some of my phone-it-in assignments got 20/20 and/or exemplary. *shrug*\n\nEven though my overall grade was very good, I didn't feel enlightened like I thought.",

            "text": "This class is a mix of introductory regarding finance and machine learning. I liked ML part a lot, it is very good introduction for people who have no prior experience of ML. Personally I could not be so interested in finance part though. Assignments (projects) are all python programming assignments (and some reports) and they were simply fun. We need to watch a long lecture video which is not designated for Udacity format but the professor explains what to implement step by step. As long as you attend Piazza regularly and ask if you need some help, someone can assist you and you should be able to complete all assignments (while the last one is bit difficult I think). I've never checked eventually but people also used Slack and it sounded very active.\n\nMidterm exam was not so difficult, it has a lot of resource to prepare but the last exam was basically with no hint for questions in advance, so it's bit random and it also asks very non-essential questions like a location of some scene in the movie....\n\nI recommend try getting full marks in assignments and attend Piazza regularly then you can get A with even 70-80 exam scores. At least for this summer class, no curve and no extra credits. Also recommend reviewing Python before the class. Also, start a project as early as possible. I first expected that I can start work on assignments after they're finalized, but sometimes it was finalized just a several days before a deadline. The differences were minimal from last semester so you shouldn't be worried about it so much.\n\nGenerally the professor and TAs are very helpful and approachable. ",

            "text": "Overall this was a course worth taking. This course covers a survey of security topics, from software security to encryption to the business/practice side of security considerations. The material is not super deep, but I found myself getting very interested in a few of the topics and choosing to learn more on my own. The course consists of 10 quizzes, 2 exams, and 4 projects. The course schedule is provided from the beginning, so it's easy to plan your time in the course well. \n\nThe quizzes come nearly straight from the books and lectures, and are designed as more of a learning/review tool than something to punish you (each quiz was approximately 2% of the final grade). The textbook is not very great if you're trying to read everything, but I took the approach of printing off the quiz and using it to guide my reading. This worked fairly well. Exams are multiple choice, and also come mostly from the book and lectures. The exams are a level at which is difficult to make a high A, but pretty easy to make a C or higher with minimal lecture/textbook participation.\n\nProjects are pretty fun. There is some amount of written analysis for three of them, but it's fairly low key (not a formal report). You'll do things like use GDB debugging to find and exploit overflows in software, look at the effects of malware on a compromised computer, explore some website exploits like XSS and XSRF, and learn to break badly-implemented encryption. Overall there is not a lot of programming - only some minor Python code in the encryption unit and mostly what you're doing is implementing some mathematical functions provided in the lectures. You'll use some Javascript, SQL, and HTML in the web security project, but it's very minimal. Overall the projects are fun and do help the learning process. There was plenty of time to complete them, even in a summer term, and they count for a substantial portion of the grade.\n\nThe course was mostly run by TAs. The professor was largely absent, but it didn't really affect the course much. The material is survey level, and TAs were able to answer any questions that were had. TAs were competent, polite, and helpful. They responded fairly quickly on any issues that occurred in the course. The lecture videos were not very good - one professor was very long winded to the point of not caring anymore, and the other was very succinct to the point of not learning enough about the material. But it was good enough to learn what you need for the quizzes and exams, so it was fine.\n\nIt is pretty easy to earn an A or B in this course by simply following the course structure and turning things in on time. It is slightly harder to come out of it knowing the material well. I put in about 6 hours per week on average, not counting some side explorations I did on the material. My suggestion is to take the course and do everything, but leave some room to explore certain concepts more deeply on the side. You'll likely encounter plenty of things you're interested in and need some time to look further. This is a great course for pairing or low-stress summer work.",

            "text": "I took this class on its own in a condensed summer term, and I found that worked well. I even took about 2 weeks off after the midterm and was still able to manage the material.\n\nCourse Work Format: Lots of weekly video lectures, plus weekly office hour sessions (live or recorded) that review the material and answer questions; 3 multiple choice (but problem based) homeworks before the midterm; a midterm (2.5 hours, 40% of grade) and a final (2.5 hours, 40% of grade). Final is not cumulative. Exams generally have a buffer of about 8% extra credit (aka max score is 108/100), so the curve in the class is nothing or minimal (2-3%).\n\nRecommendations: 1) Don't get behind with the videos; they're not the most interesting, and there are A LOT of them. However, if you watch 3-4 hours per week, you'll easily stay on schedule and feel less overwhelmed at the end; 2) Make notecards, either as you go or as a review tool when you're studying.\n\nOverall thoughts: The class requires quite a bit of memorization in order to do well on the exams, but overall is fairly easy and the exam questions are generally reasonable. (The exception to this being some of the calculation questions on the midterm... make sure you know how to do long term present value calculations quickly on your simple computer calculator- you can open a text file to write out the calculation and copy and paste into the calculator). The material could be interesting if it went more in depth, but because it is at a surface level it can be hard to understand the \"why/how\", and you end up just memorizing everything. If you can, place out of this class. If you can't, I recommend taking it as a single class over the summer, or paired with a more homework or project-based class; keep on top of the videos and memorize as you go and you'll be fine. Not the most interesting class, but it's required and it's not awful.",

The professor is dedicated to the students and very involved in the class.  It was my 1st class where the professor wasn't just a figurehead, like the Queen of England.  The lectures are fun and engaging while also being easy to follow and understand.  I feel like I learned a huge amount about HCI during the course and I'm able to apply all sorts of new concepts at work.  \n\nAssignments build on the material nicely and all the information you'll need will definitely be in that week's lecture.  They are a fair amount of writing but not a brain strain as long as you watched the lesson.  One set of assignments builds on itself each week almost like a project, while the other set is 5 stand alone assignments.\n\nThere are 2 tests using Proctortrack, a midterm and a final.  They are 100% open book, you can use whatever resources you want (even existing Piazza posts) outside of communicating with another human being during the test.  Reading the articles prior to the test made absolutely no difference in my grade because I couldn't remember the details being asked about, I did the readings for the first test and got the exact same test score on the second test having not read any of the readings beforehand.  I felt that many of the readings reiterated what had already been taught during lecture so I'd recommend only focusing on the ones that give a bit more detail on a topic you're confused about or especially interested in.\n\nThe final project was totally doable and not too time consuming but I highly recommend getting started, or at least reading it over and laying out a plan a few weeks early.  I think it could definitely be done all in one week but I chose to conduct a survey for part of mine and would have been rushed to get responses and then do the work if I'd waited until the last minute.  We didn't have a group project this semester thankfully, so I can't comment on that.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this class and appreciated the fact that I was able to learn a huge amount without being overwhelmed and stressed to the max 24/7.  It's a great beginner course to get your feet wet in the program and would pair nicely with a 2nd course if you're doing 2 at a time.  Highly recommend!",

I had read it was fabulous, but I didn't really enjoy the course, and I seem to have wasted an enormous amount of time in apparently not-useful tasks.\n\nThis course requires you to absolutely know what you'd like to do and HOW to do it BEFOREHAND. It's quite hard to learn how to do something (e.g. some advanced development, or the research process, or creating content) WHILE during the course. My mentor was absolutely useless in the process, I was left on my own but I didn't understand what the target was. Actually, I don't know whether my issue was with the class itself, or with my mentor.\n\nAdditionally, the Summer term is too short for this course, doesn't let you digest the information you need in a calm fashion.\n\nSome people in the class obviously leverage the class to create some interesting project that they would do anyway, either for their jobs or for their leisure, but the amount of time they pour into such projects is enormous and you simply can't afford to stay in the same league as theirs.\n\nI think the class has a lot of potential, but it's a source of dismay and frustration for whoever is not already \"in tune\" with it. Clearer objectives and expectations would be nicer.\n\nSummarizing: \n1) this class is mentor based. If your mentor is not great, or doesn't like you, it can give you a though time. \n2) Do what you ALREADY know how to do if you want to succeed. Don't do research if you've never done research. Don't do content if you've never created a course. Don't do development if you can't code.",

This is not to say that what is taught is not used in business, they are, and to a significant degree. It is just that the course does NOT do a good job of relating course material to business.\n\nThis course is essentially a course on all sorts of regression, basic networks, text analytics, and basic R.\n\nThe homework assignments are a joke and make up a large percentage of your grades. This does not mean it's easy to get a high mark because the final exam is very badly designed.\n\nIn our term (2018 Summer) the final exam was split into 2 parts. The first part was 50 multiple choice questions in 60 minutes, and relies on you to completely memorize all course content as no reference material is allowed what so ever. The second part is more meaningful, requiring live-coding on R, 30 questions to be done in 3 hours--which is actually very cramped. Majority of my class did not finish the second part within time.\n\nThe course could be made a lot better by linking the course material to actual business applications, going beyond basically teaching how to interpret R output, having more meaningful homework, and by having mid-terms instead of cramping everything into the final exam.",

Weekly work consisted of written assignments (~1600 words), reading book chapters and journal articles, and watching lectures, as well as background work on the project and doing peer feedback reviews.  Nothing too intense at once as long as you worked steadily throughout the term - it could be easy to fall behind on the project or more time consuming weekly assignments (ones involving surveys and interviews), and no late work is accepted.  The content was very interesting so I found it easy to succeed in the class, but there is a constant stream of work with weekly assignments that can feel burdensome at times.  I think you could work ahead and take a week or two off if you needed to, but I wouldn't recommend doing that!  Overall an interesting class that is well-run, a great option if you're looking for a break from programming.",

They're absolutely world-class.\n\nOne thing that almost made me hesitate to rate this a 5* course was that the projects seemed to be more about applied knowledge rather than the actual theory behind the OS constructs. The projects were basically creating multithreaded HTTP and file servers, parsing network packets, and calling RPC servers - projects that I would expect in a networking class. I was expecting projects more along the lines of writing a simple, primitive OS? Maybe these projects are in the next class (AOS)? For what the projects are, they were well designed, fun, and were sufficiently challenging and thought provoking.\n\n* Like all OMSCS projects, procrastinate at your peril. Some projects may appear simple until they aren't because of some small thing that just refuses to get resolved. Project submissions are limited to 10/day.\n\n* You don't need to know C to do well in this class - it appears a good number of people in the class had no previous C (or even programming) experience. But knowing at least about pointers and gdb will save you a good number of hours of struggling. Even someone like me who makes a living writing C found some of the projects to be tricky. It didn't help with taking this in the summer with the compressed schedule.\n\n* The midterm and final needed a good bit of studying to do well on. They really tested a thorough understanding of the subject matter.\n\n* There's a TA-run private Slack channel specifically for this class, which was very useful in digging up older, informative discussions.

            "text": "This was my 8th class in the OMSCS program which included taking ML4T, AI, and ML prior to this one.  Having some of that prior knowledge certainly made this class easier with respect to the reports and general flow of the course.   If you plan to take this course, I do recommend the following:\n-  Really try to watch the lectures and do the weekly readings during the period they are assigned.  This will make reviewing all that material again for the final easier to handle. \n-  What I saw a lot of people do, including myself, was stop watching the lecture videos after the first project.  The lecture videos didn't seem to provide much help with the homework and projects after that point but trying to absorb those hours of lectures before the final can be daunting.\n-  Expect a really hard final but fairly graded given its difficulty.  Professor Isbell is known for his tough and broad tests.  When they tell you that you will be tested on any of the information that is given (lectures and all external readings) it is true.\n-  Consider not doing this one over the Summer.  You are given fewer weeks than a Fall or Spring semester but have the same amount of work.\n\nOverall, this class was good, and IMO necessary if you are going to get into the field of ML.  The TAs were very good and really want you to succeed, but don't expect a whole lot coming from Professor Isbell in terms of Piazza.",

            "text": "This is a lighter course but the material is intersting and unique in the program. The course has you go through two main modules: HCI principles and HCI methods. The principles covers the high level concepts and cover ideas in usability, psychology, user modeling, and design heuristics. The methods section goes over different techniques you would employ in a user-based design process. The schedule switches between these two every week so one week you focus on principles and the next week you focused on methods.\n\nEach week has one small project (called assignments) that focus on the material being covered that week with a total of 10 assignments. Principles assignments were more general and asked broader questions. The methods assignments required you to go through redesigning an interface and most people focused on the same interface (though this was not required). There was also a semester long project that required you to redesign an interface but required you to do a wider range of tasks than the methods assignments. There were two tests that are open book, open internet with 2 hours. They were hard but not impossible. I generally studied very briefly for them.There was also a strong participation requirement. Most people fulfilled this with a mixture of participating in surveys and doing peer feedback. Some people didn't like this, I did. \n\nOverall, this course is well-structured and the teaching team is engaged. The ideas are very different from many of the other courses but I found them stimulating (the concept of distributed cognition was especially intriguing to me). There is a lot of writing involved so be ready for that but if you are interested in a course that is lighter on the coding while still being interesting, this is a great choice!\n",

            "text": "I'd avoid this course.  If you've used an RDBMS for anything other than simple selects, you won't learn much of anything.  The TA's make this class madening as they treat any question to them as wasting their time.\n\nGrading is inconsistent and dependent on the TA.  We had incidents like being told to label some field with datatypes \"such as integer, string, Boolean, and float\" then deducted points for labeling a field as a float instead of a decimal.  Regrade requests are handled by the TA that originally gave the grade, so if you draw the short straw and get a bad TA as a grader there is no hope in appealing.\n\n\nIf you really want to take the course you will have 1 giant group project split into three phases with deliverable in each phase.  The last phase will be a finished application as well as demo that will be performed in front of a TA and recorded.  There are three exams, each was open book/notes but not \"open internet.\"  The way that policy was interpreted was ANYTHING you downloaded before the exam started was fair game.  However once the exam started you couldn't access anything that wasn't on your local hard drive, (so go crazy with screen shot-ing and downloading articles/lectures before the exam starts).  Only exception to this policy was that exam 2 forbid the use of any RDBMS or similar software, as it was the exam on SQL.  Exam was proctored via ProctorTrack, and consisted of multiple choice (both select 1 and select N) as well as open numerical answers (No short answer or essay questions).\n\nSucceeding in this course is not hard, though it can be maddening.  Stay on top of your teammates and don't wait til the last minute to start work.  Be VERY picky and comb over the project requirements with a fine tooth comb.  If given UI mockups in the project reqs, match your UI to that mock up.  Your goal is to get 85+ on the three phases of the projects, then a 90+ on the exams.  Do that and you'll get the A.  The key is to get lucky with group mates and what TA is grading your project.\n\nLastly, run any sample calculations in the lectures on your on-screen calculator you'd use for a test.  You may find that you need functions that are not present.  Figure out a work-around BEFORE the test starts.  (Excel is a great at this....)",

This goes down as one of my favorite courses because of its high quality content on trading, and also because it helped us build 'applied' machine learning skills. I've taken ML courses at GT and CMU before, so I didn't come here to learn about ML as first-timer. I was planning on taking this course to do some applied machine learning and work with stuff like Pandas, numpy and I should say that I wasn't disappointed at all! \n\nThis course also served as a great introduction to trading. In fact, I've been inspired to trade using Robinhood on the side.  But that's a story for another day. Now, there were a few things that I disliked about the course and that doesn't have anything to do with the content:\n\n1) How it was run - I thought it was a mess. Frankly, TAs and the Prof. were kind of absent from Piazza. This might not be entirely a bad thing. But at some point I hoped that they intervened and confirmed a few things - such as grading questions, deadlines, rubric. I would like to thank my peers on piazza who helped people debug stuff, write test cases, and also posted strategies on tackling assignments. Yay crowdsourcing!\n\n2) The way assignments were released -  Why weren't they finalized until the last moment ( like  <5 days before the deadline) ? I do agree the most changes were really minor, but I'm highly uncomfortable doing old assignments with old information. This is a personal but I'd like to bring it up - I delayed doing all my assignments (yes even strategy learner!) until they were finalized, cause I couldn't mentally prepare myself working with old stuff that might change.\n\n3) Wiki issues - Why even have a \"Summer 2018\" page if it isn't updated. Seriously,  why couldn't 1 TA spend half a day at the beginning of the semester and update all the wiki information?  Here's what I find on the wiki page, even now, when the course has completed:\n\n\"You are on the page for information specific to the summer 2018 session of this course. Go here (Machine_Learning_for_Trading_Course) for overall course policies.\nPlease note: This page is still in revision we will announce by email when it is finalized.\"\n\n\nI feel that these issues have degraded the quality of the course quite a bit. But overall, I'm satisfied because of the great content and teaching (thanks Prof. Tucker!)\n\nThanks everyone",

Compared with Sutton's book, David Silver's lecture,  and lecture notes else where I found online, sometimes I feel our lectures explain the same concept in the weirdest way (maybe just not in line with my logic). As a result, I dont feel confident about what I've learnt. I participated in the first two help sessions organized by the TAs/TA, I feel the host (sorry I could not match face and name) explain some concepts in a very clear way, yeah, he knows what he is talking about, but after taking this class, I don't have that confidence (although I got over 90% in total).\n\nReflecting in the exam, (25T/F with one or two sentence explanation), I reviewed quite a lot but I still feel the questions are very confusing to me. I knew the questions are not supposed to be easy but I feel my problem is simply that I do not understand the topics well.\n\nThere are six assignments, they help you understand some basic theories mentioned in the lectures/papers. Seems most students got full marks. \n\nThere are three projects. Two are replicating research papers. One is a deep learning project, which gives me a very good introduction to DQN. One of the papers to replicate is very vague and I guess we are not really expected to fully replicate it.\n\nLessons I learnt:\n 1) regarding the projects, follow the requirements strictly and make it very clear in your paper that you are following them. \n2) for the reports, i feel the thinking process is more important than the actual results. As the TAs mentioned, we can write a good report without great experiment results.\n3) spend sometime learn linear programming.\n4) start to prepare/google some lecture notes for yourself earlier. It will help a lot for the review. During the last week some google docs with lecture notes prepared by old students were circulated in the slack channel, some of them are very helpful high-level abstraction of the lectures.\n\nNote: I rate it as medium difficulty because I feel the projects are manageable if you aim at being reasonable instead of being perfect in terms of the results.",

The book is quite dull, and has some repetitive content, but reading it is important for the quizzes and exams. Getting 100% of quiz points is easy but tedious, and I would argue that it's worth it for pushing your grade to an A. The exams don't do much to reinforce the content since it means drilling T/F and multiple choice questions, and some of the questions seemed out of left field. The head TA mentioned they are changing the exams for future offerings of the course, but I don't know what this means. The lecture videos are mixed - some interesting, and some just regurgitate the book. The projects are the most engaging part of the course, and do a good job of reinforcing some of the topics. There is so much time to complete each project, and I was able to do the work in a handful of days. I wished there were more of these practical exercises. Grading and feedback is fair, and the TAs are pretty active on Piazza, though the professor is not visible at all on the forums. The peer feedback for this semester was amazing, and anytime I was stuck on a project issue, my fellow students came to the rescue. There are office hours held by TAs, but these are not recorded, and I didn't attend any of them due to my time difference from the US.",

            "text": "I've been working as a software developer for 25 years, and I was expecting the class to be about the software testing process, and it was. However, to my pleasant surprise, it was a course on newer technologies (what? things have changed since I got my degree 25 years ago?) and how to leverage those technologies to effectively test and track down issues in software. The lectures (on Udacity) were well done for the most part. The quizzes (in Udacity to test your knowledge) could have been clearer, but I took them a few times to get a better understanding. No textbook. All the materials are through Udacity, though there are PDF and Powerpoint equivalents for you to study offline. There were 7 projects and for each one, a video intro is provided as well as a PDF providing detailed instructions on how to implement the project. The instructors provide a VirtualBox VM to use for all of the projects and I found it well put-together. Instructors (professor + TAs) were readily available and supportive. Knowledge of C or C++ comes in handy for a couple of the projects (pointer arithmetic). Projects require minimal coding in either C, Java, or scripting, along with one project using datalog. Lots of support through Piazza forum + slack channel. Office Hours were done using Google hangouts and if you missed it, you could play it back. \n\nWhen it came to the midterm and final, while a practice midterm and practice final were available, I felt they weren't representative to the exam itself. The midterm practice exam was actually harder than the actual exam (that's ideal, I'm overprepared), while the final preparation left me feeling overconfident since the final was much harder than the practice final exam. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the course and have many new skills that I'm looking forward to putting to use on future development projects.

            "text": "### Overview\nThis was my second class in OMSCS and with no prior experience in computer architecture, assembly, C++ or compiler theory, I found it challenging. As others have stated, the course starts with computer architecture with a focus on VLIW then moves to compilers and wraps up with optimization techniques. I found it very interesting to learn the differences between RISC and CISC processors as well as the VLIW processor design philosophy. Embedded processors are everywhere (cars, phones, network equipment, control systems, etc.) and their unique power and performance requirements drive a much different processor design. In particular, embedded processors rely the compiler to do many of the optimizations that would typically be done on-chip in a desktop processor. Professor Pande clearly has passion in this area and several of the optimizations presented in the last part of the class are based on research that he has published in collaboration with others.\n\n### Projects\nThere are 2 projects in the course, and they are both done with a partner. You will be asked to pair up on your own so be sure to jump on Piazza as soon as this process starts so that you don't get left in the dust. The first project was to build a scheduler which would take assembly-like input (VEX), build a graph data structure and then produce a parallel schedule. This project required C++. The second project really required more analysis and little to no coding. You will be benchmarking a couple of programs on the Raspberry Pi and then determining which functions should optimized. Although I absolutely love tinkering with the Raspberry Pi, I didn't find this project interesting at all. One of the whiz kids in my class gave a detailed post about how one of the design goals of recent ARM processors was to completely eliminate the need to perform the sort of analysis that we were asked to do. The instructions for the second project were particularly poor and several fundamental questions went completely unanswered by the TAs. This is maybe the biggest area that could be improved. \n\n**NOTE:** As others have mentioned, the project instructions talk about using the DeepThought system to compile and run your code but this is a complete waste of time. The entire thing can be done from a VM on your local machine and DeepThought is fraught with issues. I strongly recommend that you do not waste a single second on DeepThought. I suspect the TAs were new this semester and will help you avoid this pitfall in the future by updating the instructions.\n\n### Homework\nThere are 4 homework assignments which each took a bit of time to complete. Homework 2 required C++ programming but all the other assignments were theory only. I found it helpful to have a good diagramming tool (Lucidchart in my case) since several of the questions asked us to produce visualizations.\n\n### Final Exam\nI thought the comprehensive final was fair but there were a few mistakes in the instructions that left me hoping the question would be thrown out. We were given 3 hours and I needed the whole time to complete. I think the homework assignments and lectures helped to prepare me, although I didn't read a couple of the assigned papers and I'm confident that hurt me.\n\n### Summary\nThe content of this class was interesting and helped me fill in some gaps from my undergrad (computer architecture, assembly and compiler theory). Project 1 was fun but Project 2 felt completely obsolete and poorly supported. The homework assignments were a bit time consuming but manageable. Overall I would recommend the course.",

            "text": "This is my second class and it was better organized than my first one (CS6262 Security). The workload depends on how you want to study. If you read the book, which I recommend to succeed in the three exams, you will spend about 8h per week. Mostly because reading and watching the lecture will take you that amount. Then you will have at least 6h per week on the assignment if you already know database and frontend development. This is where it gets bad. Why is there so much work requiring developing a whole website? It is not related to database and sinks hours that could have been invested into the development of SQL.\n\nThe TAs were military strict: answers were dry and rough (at least the one that was leading the pack). There were many exams questions that were not well written which was subject to interpretations. More preparation should be done and people with experience on how to write question should be involved in the process.\n\nOverall, it is a-okay course but I saw some people struggling because they did not know database which was not my case. I was able to get a final grade of 'A' but I had to work more than expected. As I mentioned, I have been working with SQL for many years and still, I had to spend many hours per week. Also, nothing about new database technologies. Nothing about cloud, scalability, cluster, NoSQL, etc. The course seems to be written in early 2000.\n\nI had the change to be with 3 other teammates that wanted to work and succeed which was pleasant. This course could have been a nightmare otherwise and I might have had to spend more than 14h/week. If you are with lazy or bad teammates you can easily spend 20h/week.\n\nPros:\n-  More organized than the first course I took from GT\n-  Assignments are clear\n-  TA Active on Piazza\n\nCons:\n- Old tech\n- Too much emphasis on the web (UI)\n- 1 or 2 examples maximum per topic. You must rely on the book and on the Internet\n- TAs are not friendly at all\n- Piazza is used by people to fight for a better grade, I stop going on Piazza after few weeks, it was negative and depressing.\n- The instructor is absent from the class\n- Youtube TAs weekly presentations are not clear. I was able to see only one, every other time the link was saying \"not available\" and never could be \"live\" because of the time zone.\n",

            "text": "I found the course to be pretty interesting as it made me explore a different aspect of security which was quite an unknown zone for me and it had some decent projects though I really disliked the pacing of this course. Piazza was quite active for the most part with TA's/students sharing articles/papers/news outside of the course content but still related to the subject matter. I really loved the documentary related to Stuxnet that was shared - well worth a watch.\n\nI took the summer version - and there were 3 projects. First project was quite easy and required the use of Schneider Electric's SoBasic. Second project was related to the protocols that you will study during the course - Modbus/DNP3 - I personally did horrible on this one as I was in the middle of relocating between countries due to my Job. But the class median on this project was quite high so I think it would have been doable, I just did not have the time to do it properly. The third project was nice and a bit tricky also - it required knowledge of using gdb to ultimately exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability. There was a 15 point extra credit on this project also.\n\nExams were fair, questions did not seem ambiguous but they were extremely short. They give you 2h 50mins for the final exam that you can complete in 10 minutes - I don't understand the point of this. The first exam was 1 hour and frankly it had more questions where some \"thought\" was needed and there the 1 hour time was somewhat justified. Final exam is cumulative.\n\nComing to the pacing - I don't know who has decided this schedule but there's practically nothing that happens during the first few weeks and very little even in the first month and then you finally get something to do from the mid-term till the end. It would be really worthwhile to adjust the schedule and put two projects before the midterm instead of just one. Currently, the workload is a bad factor to judge this course on. Not saying the workload is too much, it's just not indicative of the reality - I don't think I ever spent 7 hours per week, but certainly spent 20+ hours on the 3rd project trying to figure out a silly error. \n\nOverall, it was a decent course. My complain is the awkward pacing and the fact that the grading is quite weird - you basically have to do great on everything. With 100% in two projects and 90% in both exams, I still ended up with only a solid B since the second project pretty much screwed me over as I got a 50%. And since the overall class median/average is quite high, you cannot expect a curve. So if you have some important personal/job related stuff come up after the mid-term, then it could affect your performance in some projects. ",

            "text": "I completed SA&T the summer of 2018 as my fourth course in OMSCS and will say it was the most well-directed, organized, and supported course I have taken in the program so far.  The instructor and TAs had great attitudes about the class and material and were active and helpful on Piazza and Slack.  The lectures were understandable, interesting, and directly related to the labs and exams.  The labs were prepared very well with an almost flawless VM.  Preparing each lab's file structure on the VM and collecting the deliverables was not painful but not seamless either.  The exams were fair but challenging.  \n\nThe course material has a heavy emphasis on Software Analysis vice Test.  While the majority of the material is still interesting and was mostly in line with my expectations, I was hoping for more material on best practices of testing in the industry.  The third and fourth lab (Dataflow and Datalog) were quite challenging, and full understanding is needed for a good grade on the exams as well.  Dataflow and Datalog are worthwhile topics, but I would have benefited from more complex examples or references of these topics.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend taking this course.  Being familiar but not fully proficient with C, C++, Java and bash scripting was enough background that I felt comfortable with the course prerequisite knowledge.  I ended up with a B because I put the hours in for the labs and did just well enough on the exams.  I would have rather taken it in Spring or Fall to get more time to digest the material and have had a chance at an A.",

            "text": "The material itself was not too difficult especially if you have years of database experience. That said, the exams were artificially difficult because of gotcha questions and ambiguity. I don't feel like the exams did a particularly good job of testing your knowledge. What they really tested was how good of a test taker you are and how good you were at paying attention to details in a proctored environment. An example of this was a question that asked for the answers that were NOT applicable to the prompt instead of which ones were. If you misread the question after just spending 5 minutes or so writing out functional dependencies on notebook paper then your grade suffered tremendously because the tests only had about 25 questions. This is a course where you can know 95% of the material really well but do poorly on the exams because of the way the questions are written. Additionally, the course would have been more more effective if there was a greater focus put on NoSql databases and overall database performance techniques. I left this class feeling like I had A level knowledge but my grade didn't reflect that. The one good thing about the course was the final group project. The TA's did a good job of setting forth clear requirements that dovetailed with what was taught in the course",

You will learn how to design surveys, how to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis (such as setting up hypothesis testing) among a lot of other things.\n\nThe subject material is pretty challenging. You will learn \"principles\" and \"methods\" and then apply them to an area of research you have chosen and write weekly essays to demonstrate your knowledge. \n\nParticipation points can be earned in a number of ways. It's sort of like an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can participate in surveys, contribute to discussions in piazza, do peer feedbacks on others' essays. You can do a little of this, a little of that, or whole lot one thing until you hit the maximum 100 points (for 10% of the grade).\n\nExams were not easy. I think the average on the exams were ~85%, which means the average student had to do better than 90% on everything else to get an A, since the grading was straight scale. \n\nThe professor, Dr. Joyner is by far the best professor I've had. Truly knows what's he's talking about, and very passionate about the subject. You will learn a LOT in this course. Every student in the program should take this course.",

However, note that the basis provided is for math; a lot of the material goes towards helping the student understand what goes on under the hood so there is quite a bit of probability, statistics, and calculus in the course. Overall, maybe 80% has to do with the math and about 20% is actually using simulation and the simulation language. There will be demonstrations and case studies, but those will be more for self-enrichment as the exams cover the math and simulation concepts.\n\nGrade breakdown came to 3 exams (30% each), one cheat sheet for exam 1, two cheat sheets for exam 2, and three cheat sheets for exam 3. Exams were very reasonable and most of the exams had high B/low A average for a class of 50 or so in SU2018. Last 10% is homework.\n\nProfessor is an interesting and animated guy who keeps his long lectures interesting (compared to management who keeps their long lectures boring). Lecture material goes into a lot more proofs than most people would be comfortable with, and whether it contributes to learning...your mileage may vary. Second pass at development could probably benefit from cutting down on proofs and shifting the bandwidth towards a solo or group project to simulate some real-world process. Otherwise, lots was learned in this class and is worth taking - would like to see a part two of this class for the above.",

Buyer beware, the class does not prepare you for the final exam - questions asked are nitpicky and memorization based with no cheat sheet for the MC.

If you don't know anything about DB I would suggest you read some of the book as the exams are not based solely on what is taught in the lectures. One group project, First 2 phases of the project are design based so sort of tedious, Last phase is implementation and thus more engaging. You will create a simple website interface  (teach yourself this as the project is very open ended) to work with your created DB.

            "text": "Just finished up Embedded Systems for the Summer of 2018. As an embedded hardware engineer, and having a strong hardware background in school, I found this class absolutely fascinating. It sort of fills a lot of \"low level gaps\" that you don't ever really think about when it comes compiling code for embedded hardware. You will definitely need a strong C/C++ background going into this class. Other classes that I had under my belt from undergrad that helped me were Digital Logic, Digital Design, and Microprocessors. Working as a full time professional, I found the work load manageable.\n\nI am not sure how this class flows during a normal spring / fall semester, but the summer semester it did feel pretty condensed and very quick pace, there was absolutely no down time in between lectures, projects, and home works. The home works and projects overlapped. During the first project, i had to stop working it, get the one of the homeworks done, and then pick the project back up, which i found kind of annoying.   If you think you might need a slower pace, I would recommend taking this class in the fall or spring. \n\nThe lectures were done very well. Dr. Santosh is very thorough, clear, and concise. There were a few errors in some of the lectures, but they were usually pretty obvious when you came across them, and there was an erratta provided to give you a heads up. The lectures followed the reading material very well, which included the textbooks, and the assigned academic papers (some written by the professor himself). The class is very well organized and broken down into 3 distinct sections: \n1. Review of Computer Architecture and crash course into VLIW design philosophy. \n2. Compilers Compilers Compilers. Front end and back end. \n3. Compiler Optimizations (my favorite part of the class). \n\nThe very first lecture you dive head first into assembly language,  if you have never had any experience with assembly, you might have some catching up to do, but i dont think it would be too overwhelming. This class assumes you have a working knowledge with the fundamental processor architecture building blocks, such as ALU's, IR's, Registers, Memory, Program Counters ect... so the first section is a pretty quick refresher, but it doesn't really go into the hardcore nuts and bolts of how an ALU works for example. Parts 2 and 3 use a ton of graph theory, and a ton of graph theory algorithms , which i found fascinating. I had almost NO background in graph theory, and I was able to manage just fine. \n\nFor the summer semester, we had 4 homeworks and 1 project broken down into two different parts.  The projects were pretty distinct from each other, so it felt like two separate projects rather than 1 project. Both projects were group projects.  The home works were pretty straight forward, they pulled from the reading material and lectures, but they were pretty involved. When the homeworks get into the graph theory, I found myself writing programs to help solve the problems as they are not very practical to do by hand. For this, i mostly used Python. Homeworks were \"pen and paper\" style. \n\nThe first project was the most intense part of the entire course. It was done in C++. I work mostly in C, so brushing up on my C++ was pretty quick, if you haven't had either, you will be at a disadvantage. I easily spent more hours on this project than I did on all 4 homeworks and project 2 combined, and then some. Enter my first complaint of the course: the project 1 description. it was vague, ambiguous, impervious to clarity, and riddled with copy/paste errors. I am not saying this to just complain, it really was pretty bad. It needs to be revised (See other reviews of this class, they will say the same thing). The TA's were basically absent from piazza to to provide clarification, which was pretty frustrating. I had asked for clarification on one of the requirements via the project description (which was unclear), and I did not receive a response until the night before the project was due, by then I had already \"made an assumption\", which ended up being incorrect. I had also already turned the project in, which I had to redo a pretty good chunk of my code and resubmit, which was absolutely miserable. The Deepthought Clusters stopped working about 2 days into the project, and this issue was never resolved. To overcome this, I ended up just putting vagrant on my machine and avoided using Deepthought all together. Some students wasted a good bit of time with service tickets / requests to no avail and a lot of wasted time. Despite all of this, I absolutely loved the project, it makes practical, a lot of theory and gives you a lot of appreciation for it. \n\nProject 2 was pretty straight forward, and had an open ended element to it, which opened the door for creativity, which i really appreciated. For this project you needed to purchase a raspberry pi board, as the focus of the project was around ARM processors. This project was mostly analysis and very little coding, it did, however, seem to be sort of dated, as we were not using the most up to date ARM compiler. Not as interesting as the first project. Project description again, lacked in clarity one certain parts, some of which were never clarified by the TA's. Deepthought still was an issue, and by this point , I think everyone was just using Vagrant. \n\nThe final exam was pretty terrible. For being 33% of your entire grade, and the only exam, it was a little bit stressful. It was cumulative, so it was a ton of material that it covered. I didnt really know what to expect. It is done via Proctor Track, which i felt like was completely inadequate for how they expected you to enter your responses. There were also mistakes on the actual exam questions, which i was hoping they were going to throw out, but I dont think they did. It was 3 hours, and it took most of the time to complete. \n\nMy only other complaint with this class was the TA's, as i hinted above. Im not sure if they were just super busy or what, but they were just not around at all. Being a smaller class size, the student to student interaction was definitely not as active as other larger classes I have had, but the TA's EASILY averaged a 2-3 day turnaround time with questions. Probably the worse TA experience I have had in the OMSCS program to date. \n\nGrading was done very fairly. \n\nOverall, I thought this class was pretty great, and recommend it for any hardware guys out there. This class certainly has a lot of potential, and is certainly one of my favorites in the OMSCS program. I think if they were to clean up the project descriptions, and just avoid Deepthought all together, it could be improved. \n\n",

If you have decent R skills, then it will make your life easier. Python helps too later in the course for some of the homework. The only downside is that this course moves quickly, each week is a new model, if not multiple models. In the summer, the same homework is given, but you have less weeks, which means each homework has more problems than in the fall or spring. I'd imagine the roughly 12 hours a week I spent on this course would be around 10 or less during the spring/fall.",

            "text": "This course extends what is taught in ML (even using the same video lectures) and consists of 6 homeworks (5% each, normally taking 1-5 hours), 3 projects (15%, each, taking anywhere from 20-60 hours for me) and a final (25%, 2 hours, T/F with explanation). \n\nThe homeworks are generally fairly easy once you get the core problem, which most people do. They are autograded and you get a few submissions so you know your grade immediately. The first project is replicating a research paper and is relatively easy and not that interesting. Project 2 was a lot of fun, but much harder - it's the lunar lander problem from openAI gym. Project 3 was the hardest of the lot, involving linear programming to replicate another research paper. The grading was pretty haphazard and depended heavily on which TA you got. One tip is that the code does not matter at all - it doesn't matter if you replicate the research or not, it only matters that you talk about the algorithms used in the research paper. The exam was similar to the T/F questions from ML, and takes about 45 minutes to an hour (no rush).\n\nThe lectures are comically bad. Unfortunately you do need to watch them to know what is going to be on the exam. As everyone has mentioned, watch David Silver's lectures first, then just skim through the Udacity lessons and try not to let them disrupt the things you learned from Silver. I also used a course from Udemy which helped. \n\nPros:\n- The TAs seem like nice people. I didn't find the office hours super helpful, but Miguel and Tim were capable head TAs, and Miguel held special 'help sessions' for the homeworks.\n- The slack channel was great.\n\nCons:\n- Abysmal lectures. If this was a paid Coursera MOOC I would ask for my money back and then some more for damages. \n- Projects aren't really related to the material.\n- No rubric for projects.\n- Haphazard grading. If you get generous TAs you will get an A. \n\n\nWith all the good, free resources on ML and RL online, it's amazing that this course hasn't yet been Joyner-ified to catch up with them. Do this course because you need it for the ML specialization, not because you want to learn RL. \n",

The hexbug project was a group project and meant to be the hardest, however, you can use scikit learn to basically do it for you so it ends up being trivial. The warehouse robot project involved having a robot navigate a maze to locate packages. However, the robot is allowed to walk through walls so there is really no maze that needs to be navigated. Releasing a project in this state to students would never have happened at my previous college. The runaway robot project is fun, but the later parts are unconnected to the lectures. \n\nBy far the most annoying thing about this course is the number of errata in the materials. Too many lectures have written notes correcting the material covered in the video. Too many homework problems give you code to work on that is incorrect. Fixing this would markedly improve the learning experience, I don't understand why a college with the resources of GT doesn't do this.\n\nThis course is what made me go from recommending the OMSCS to my co-workers, to actively telling them to avoid it. \n\n",

Still interesting though, to see how ML and AI can help with trading securities. and this course's work load is perfect for a relaxing summer. Except the final project+repot took me 3 whole days, others (first 5 projects, 2 exams) are pretty light. There's also a homework to watch movie \"the big short\", which is interesting.\n\nI wish there's a follow up course that gets deeper into how ML can do with trading, but this course is a great introduction to people with minimum exposure to finance, hedge fund, python, pandas, and machine learning. Especially for the point that Dr. Balch would give very detailed guidance for home assignment/projects, which could be very helpful for learning, but maybe not that interesting for more experienced students.\n\nI would highly recommend as one of the first courses to get you started in OMSCS program.",

I would recommend doing this in the summer term if you are \"moderately\" interested (not doing II specialization) in the topic since there is no extended group project and thus a bit less work compared to the regular semester. I was able to finish the entire coursework about 4 weeks early (except Test 2 which was opened a week later). The class is entirely essay/test based so if you want a break from coding/debugging for a term this is one to take. I personally find that coding assignments are a bit more unpredictable in time commitment than writing assignments so this is a great class if you need to front load/work ahead as I had to. Baby ended up coming after I finished Test 2 so we timed it right!\n\nI thought the course videos were well done, the projects and assignments were interesting and covered many academic disciplines. Some of the papers felt tedious to read, though most were interesting - knowing content of readings is 50% of each test. \nOverall, I feel like I am much more conscious of interface design and felt this was a practical course for a professional software engineer.

The class seems to be designed from the ground up to scale for being online, and it makes a huge difference.\nI agree with other reviews that this course comes more from an engineering perspective than a science perspective. Principles are taught in class and they are useful in the projects, but the projects will throw some real-world curveballs at you, so you need to do some real-world problem solving, and find some workable heuristics to use with the principles. And if you find a 'cheap' solution that doesn't even use the class material, that's okay - the rule here is if it works, it's not stupid! That's a delightful approach; without it, students sometimes end up having to play \"guess what the instruct is expecting you to think\".",

            "text": "I'm really on the fence about this class, even almost two weeks after being done.  A slant towards dislike due to the poor grading policies.  This is my 5th class in the program.  My only ML background is ML4T and in retrospect I kind of wish I took ML first.\n\nI didn't watch David Silver's lectures until I started reviewing for the final.  I only watched a few and I'm not really sure how helpful they were.  I enjoyed the lecture format for the Udacity RL lectures, but I don't really know how much I actually learned from them.  I'm in the same boat as the other reviewer who finished with 90% with a cursory understanding of the material.  My % was less but still an A, thanks to a very generous curve.\n\n6 homeworks (30% total), 3 individual projects (45% total), 1 final exam (25%).  Final is 25 T/F questions with explanations for each, whether we think T or F, and <b>everything</b> is fair game, including all lectures and all 30ish papers (a small number of which were more like books) we were assigned to read.\n\nI thought HW 1 was the hardest one by far.  Each is challenging in its own way but once you have that \"aha\" moment they're very simple.  I never got that with HW1 but I did find another way to do it.  And since we run our code on provided test cases and submit answers to an autograder (limit of 10 tries per problem, which I found to be way more than needed, which is good), it doesn't matter whether we code it the \"right\" way or not.  Overall I had a lot of fun with the HWs.\n\nProjects are coding with a report.  Project 1 was about replicating results in a research paper.  I enjoyed it since it was a perfect mix of everything.  Challenging, but not so challenging that I just sat there wondering what to even do.  It was rewarding to generate results and interesting to compare with classmates' results.  Then came the grades.  I lost nearly 10% for not doing something that wasn't even mentioned in the project description.  Well, I actually did do it, but I didn't write about it because our reports had a hard limit of 5 pages.  Given everything we had to write about and the types of graphs we had to include, it was a real struggle to stay in the limit, so the amount of extra stuff we can put in there is tiny, if anything at all.  Based on class feedback it seemed like a common occurrence to lose points for things not specifically required.  Speaking of feedback, many students said their feedback on P1 was extremely vague.  I didn't have this problem on P1, but this was fixed in general for P2 and P3.\n\nSeveral students asked for full rubrics to clarify the P1 grades, and the TAs were very adamant about not giving those out.  I completely understand why they don't want to do that (and I was surprised that ML4T essentially does do that), but it would have been nice for them to meet us halfway.  It's very frustrating to be docked points for something you <b>(1)</b> have no idea you're supposed to do, and <b>(2)</b> can't fit into the report anyway because you're squeezing everything you were told to do in the 5-page limit.  I teach and this is something I would never do to my students, which it makes it all the more frustrating.\n\nP2 was the OpenAI gym lunar lander project.  I had fun with this at first but then it turned into a game of \"find the parameters\", which I find tedious, dull, and not educational.  Parameter tuning is a big part of ML, RL, CV, etc., and it is why I'm heavily disinterested in these subjects now.  I honestly don't know if I even want to take ML anymore.\n\nP3 was replicating research results again, this time using game theory and linear programming.  This was challenging in an unpleasant way (sitting there wondering what to even do) but once I got over that hurdle it was a little more enjoyable, even if it was a little tedious.  In the end I lost a few points for reasons similar to P1.\n\nThis was the first course I've taken where we had absolutely no starter code for projects or homeworks.  I like that since it's generally more rewarding to code something functional completely from scratch.\n\nOverall, this is definitely my least favorite class so far.  But I highly enjoyed the other ones I've taken, so that's not necessarily saying this course is terrible.  I guess I'm glad to have taken it, but... I don't know, it just wasn't what I was expecting I guess.  I absolutely do not recommend this as a first course unless you have some hardcore ML/RL experience.  I don't know if I recommend it at all, but you will need to take it if you're doing the ML spec and you want to avoid group projects.",

Project 3 in particular had an auto-graded section that I just bombed because multiple answers were dependent on getting certain hashed values correct. Came out with a B solely because of that project. I've heard other semesters had extra credit offered, and it would be nice to have had that opportunity.\n\nOverall I would say this course is below-average. When you get things incorrect for the project, the grading isn't helpful about specifying what you should have done differently, which means that the course doesn't offer much as a learning experience beyond what is already accessible in any security textbook.",

The course uses java and android as programming languages (all but one of the individual assignments were in java, group project was andriod as was one of the assignment). I had java experience but no andriod but this did not prove to to be a challenge. Grading was slow but lenient. Important to read the assignment instructions carefully since the grading is tied to completing each ask. Office hours were good and a the professor and head TA's were open to provide hints/tips, so make sure that you go over the office hours video offline.\n\nOver all a good but easy class. ",

This made it very difficult to study for the final when it was unclear what the correct answers were to some of the homework questions. The first project was building a scheduler for VLIW code and I think I learned more about C++ (had never used it before) than actually scheduling. The second project used a Raspberry Pi and to be honest - was incredibly pointless. If you do enough research into what the project is asking you do to, you'll realize that it is completely obsolete. The exam had a lot of weird questions and typos that made the questions even more confusing and was pretty poorly written.\n\nThe biggest annoyance I had with this class was the lack of responses from the TAs on Piazza. It would take days to weeks to get a response to a simple question, and most questions were left unanswered past the due dates for projects or homeworks that they were asking about. Even at the end of the semester there were almost 40 unread/unanswered posts. \n\nOverall, I  would not recommend this course until the revamp the homework/projects/test. ",

Dr. Joyner is definitely one of the most interactive and engaging professors I have ever had between on-campus @ GT and OMSCS. The weekly assignments are fairly easy but I would allocate ample amount of time to think about the \"M\" assignments as they require you to think about a specific task to redesign.\n\nThe entire syllabus is uploaded at the beginning of the semester, so you know what lies ahead. Tests are open-book, but test your knowledge pretty well. There is a lot of reading material required, but being open book, I recommend downloading them and having them searchable as it is just an absurd amount of information to remember for the test material.\n\nThe group portion of the project was eliminated for the Summer term, but I thought this actually served for the better due to my schedule. It was interesting redesigning an interface after learning the principles and why what we consider good designs are what they are.\n\nDefinitely a good course, especially now that it is a foundational course. I strongly recommend anyone who may ever need to create any sort of interface to take it.",

The projects are interesting and engaging with some much harder than others, and you learn useful tools (depending on the languages you work with--most tools apply to C, C++ or Java. The new project intro videos help you to quickly get acclimated for each project. Chris Pouch is co-professor and he is excellent. I found him tremendously helpful in office hours (Slack), on Piazza and in the Q&A sessions he hosted. I got stuck on several projects and his hints were instrumental in me doing well on (and completing) the projects. As long as Chris is part of this course, I recommend taking it, but you really need to be familiar with C/C++--at a minimum, I recommend taking IOS (CS6200) as a prerequisite (also an excellent course with an excellent professor); in addition, go through the Essential C/C++ course on Lynda.com. The TAs, for the most part, were helpful as well, although they weren't always sure how much they could help. In the interest of full disclosure, I got an A (but barely). \n\nNote that this course should really be called Software Analysis; there was only one project that concentrated on testing--this is -NOT- a course about writing unit tests.\n\nUnfortunately, this course continues what I consider a disturbing trend in OMSCS: students are hyper-cautious/paranoid about helping each other due to potential honor code violations. Some courses (IOS when I took the first run of it in Spring 2015) are a little looser when applying the honor code, but most courses are so strict with it that it makes public Piazza and Slack help request/question posts pretty much pointless. The result is that the only replies worth anything are from the professor and/or TAs.  ",

Just ask a single question and wait for a response.  \n-Course load is too heavy. Less would give more time to absorb the material.  Could probably be split into 2 courses with markov games as a separate class.  \n-One or two office hours with the course instructor per semester would be very helpful.  \n-Grading is a mystery, especially for projects.  \n-Better rig gives you an advantage especially on projects 2 & 3.

It covers regular expressions, DFA, NFA, scanner, parser, Code optimization, and machine code generation. There are two group projects \n which are demanding (parser & code optimization and generation). We used Antlr to implement the compiler. Antlr is a very powerful library that applies to many applications including compiler design. The assignments were time consuming but well designed reflecting course material. Compilers are very complex and this course is a good introduction if you are interested in this field.   ",

That said, having some way to organize your design graphically turns out to be very useful, and it's all the more so if it's a system that's consistent enough to be easily gradable. But the real reason to take this class is the dive into design patterns. You won't have to, necessarily. I think you only have to compare and contrast 4 for the final paper, but having an environment where you have time set aside to really explore different ways of solving problems (and people standing by to answer your questions) turns out to be pretty valuable in the long run.",

            "text": "AI4R was a great class! It was a suitable option for summer session, as the third project, which is definitely a difficult and time consuming one, was dropped. There were opportunities for extra credit as well, which was great if you were wanting to ensure you don't just miss out on a grade by a percent or two.\n\nThe lectures are well done, but you will have to do a lot of extra reading to supplement the videos. It's not too bad, but I can understand if people are put off by this fact, especially if they're not expecting it. The videos do a good job of covering the foundations and touch on some of the more advanced details, but you will likely have to read some papers or other resources to get a handle on more advanced techniques and implementation of these techniques.\n\nThe projects are fairly well defined; we had two mini-projects, and two full projects. The full projects were definitely time consuming, so I would suggest starting on them soon after release. Even if it's just playing around with different ideas and trying different approaches, it will help you get a handle on how the problems are set up and how you should be tackling them. The nice thing about the projects is that they're fairly open-ended in terms of implementation, as you can choose from a few viable algorithms or approaches to solve the problems.\n\nAssignments are your answers to the quizzes in the Udacity videos. You also have to upload your code and answers to ensure nothing gets lost in case Udacity loses your answers on their end. These were easy and basically a free 30%.\n\nTAs were excellent; they were extremely responsive and informative. Assignment and project grades were given back VERY fast, sometimes in the same day.\n\nAll-in-all, it was a well-run class and I would highly recommend. If you want to learn SLAM, which is an important and very powerful algorithm for robot localization and mapping, to the fullest extent the class can offer, I would advise taking this during the regular term so you don't miss out on project 3. Be warned that it IS very difficult, however. So if you don't mind missing out on this last project, this class is a decent choice for summer. Though it's probably still not the easiest, it's enjoyable and very much doable.",

I personally am not a fan of writing essays and reading a few chapters a week for class. This class was pretty doable in the summer, but there was something due every single week which can be a pain sometimes. There are also a lot of opportunities for extra credit which can be done via Piazza or Peer Feedback. One thing that I did enjoy though was Professor David Joyner's dedication to the class. He made new discussion threads almost every weekday during the week. I would recommend this class not necessarily as a first course but something to take early on in the program.",

            "text": "So, I really wanted to like this course more. It was a good intro to ML, but don't expect to be able to do any real trading after. The techniques taught are fairly basic and you would be destroyed if you actually tried to use them outside of the carefully controlled toy environment.  \n\nThe course was abbreviated over the summer (one of the projects was dropped, leaving 6). The lectures were pretty good, although both textbooks were totally unnecessary.  \n\nI have two main complaints. The exams were trivial to the point of meaningless. There were questions on a movie that we were asked to watch (The Big Short) that you could have got the answers to by watching the trailer (they weren't financial questions either). The other questions were related to the material, but if you cram the relevant lectures in for a few hours before taking the exam, you're guaranteed to get a 90 or above (unless you just can't remember simple facts - little to no math required).  \n\nSecondly, although this clearly wasn't the first time this course had been run throughout the summer, it may as well have been. Projects weren't finalized (or available on Canvas) until the last minute, and the final (hardest) project was still having fairly major tweaks right up until the weekend before it was due.  \n\nLuckily, this didn't affect me because I'm lazy and had barely started it at that point, but others were not happy.  \n\nIn short, this is an easy course if you keep your wits about you. You'll likely have more difficulty keeping up with the changing requirements than you will with the actual material. So yeah - a fairly realistic preparation for real work in that sense.  \n\nOverall, I recommend it, but you may not get as much out of it as you would hope.  \n\nAdditionally, some of the TAs were really unhelpful to the point of antagonism. I didn't personally run into this, luckily, but there were others that did.  ",

            "text": "This was my second course in the OMSCS program. I had taken IOS(CS6300) in Spring2018 prior this class. Coming from such a great class IOS was, this class was terrible. It is easy to get an A but I did not get very much learning out of it, which is why I am doing this program in the first place. On weeks when assignment was due, you can cram it out and on other weeks that don't have anything due, there would be almost no work except watch some videos. There was a lot of cramming in the end for the final project. Here is the break down:\n\nPros:\n - Easy to get an A\n - No exams so don't need to stress over material of the lectures\n - Can kind of BS your way through since design is very subjective and there is never a \"right\" answer\n\nCons:\n - TA's are not very helpful AT ALL, rarely answers piazza posts clearly or even at all. There is no slack channel for concept discussion and questions. \n - Assignments take a LONG time trade. Since it takes forever for you to get your assignment back, and even when you do get it back, you don't get any feedback so you don't know if what you did was actually correct or not, even though you got a decent grade. Because of that, I went through the entire course not knowing what things I did right or wrong. Up to this point I still do not know what I did for my assignments were correct or not, it was all \"my best guess, and what made sense for me\", but it would be very helpful to see other ways of doing the assignments, what to do and what not to do.\n - Final project was just kind of thrown at you and he tells you to just go do it. There is no progression or guide in how to do the project so it is overwhelming at first, especially if you don't have very experienced team members. Also absolutely no feedback for our final project. We spent 85% of our time doing the database which was worth 15 points and we ended up getting 0/15 for some unknown reason. We message the TA and professor and we get no response. It is just so unprofessional.\n - Lecture materials apparently are very important concepts but videos do not go over many examples or go in depth to explain anything, how to implement concepts, how the concept compares to another solution. The professor presents the material and thats it. If someone like me has never heard or ever seen what the professor is talking about, I do no learning.\n\nTips:\n - Try to meet up with local students and discuss over topics in lectures and homework requirements (of course following the collaboration policy). This is because design is very subjective. There is never a \"right\" way to design something. That is what makes the course content difficult to learn.",

The exams had vague questions that could be interpreted multiple ways, tricky questions and questions that I believe had multiple answers. There were 3 exams counting for about 50% of the grade. The means for the exams I believe were low.  There was talk of a different distribution for an A,B,C as in past years… but I don’t believe we received anything different this year. The exams caused a lot of drama where students would challenge the answers, some were overturned but I felt there was a negative tone on piazza with a lot of bickering, limiting my comfort zone on asking questions. I enjoyed the project and team work, it has 3 phases and was progressive one phase building on the other.  I had great teammates.\nI believe the class would be better if the exams are improved upon or the material on the exams is taught. I enjoyed Leo Mark's lectures on Udacity but was disappointed he wasn't involved in the class.",

(It could be used to prepare for some sections of Compilers, if desired.) This is a good class to pair with another light-workload class, or with a heavy-workload class; I only had to spend 0-4 hours/week on this, and was often ahead in this class.\n\nAll lectures and labs/projects became available at the start of the class. We were free to move through the material at our own pace (and people did move ahead faster than the syllabus). The lectures were helpful and informative, and covered a wide range of topics in software analysis. The projects were very related to the lectures and were very manageable - the staff put in lots of effort to ensure that the administrivia go smoothly and we can focus on the concept we're trying to learn. I finished some of the labs in 2-3 hours, while the longest one took ~10 hours.\n\nI didn't do as well as I'd have liked on the midterm and final, but the projects were enough to offset that; and we were allowed to drop our lowest project grade.\n\nPersonally, I would have liked to cover type systems in more depth, and devote a project to them. I'm told that such a project is being developed, so maybe you'll get to do it instead. :)",

The first assignment was easily the hardest in the class- it involved designing an AI to defeat a 2 queen board game. It really tested my Python skills to the limit and I learnt a lot. 2nd assignment was about tri-directional search, and I spent hours debugging my code to solve the problem. Really loved and learnt a lot from both these projects!\n\nI learnt lot of practical skills such as alpha beta pruning, min-max trees, search, information retrieval, HMMs, bayesian inference, reinforcement learning, probability etc. from this class. Prof Thrun was excellent in his classes on bayesian inference. Really enjoyed them. The book was also excellent, though it is very big and hard to read at times.\n\nOverall, the class is really excellent, and really one of the best in OMSCS. Its a great survey class as well for machine learning and AI in general. The highlight of this course is the 2 exams which are open book for a week. I feel that's the a better way to run an exam because if there is a topic I am weak at, I can just read up and attempt to solve it. This really expanded my skills and learnt a lot!\n\nHighly recommended class, but perhaps not as the first one!",

In retrospect, I wish I had taken this before AI, which is a brutal introduction to similar topics.\n* NO GROUP PROJECTS! All projects are individual.\n* Light course load. The assignments don't change much (usually at all) between semesters and are available.\n* The assignments are easy if you understand the material. This is not a given in other classes.\n* The assignment have local tests which are basically the whole grade. Looking at you, AI.\n* No dealing with Bonnie.\n\nCONS:\n* Multiple choice exams that are sometimes arbitrary. The final had at least 5 question about \"The Big Short\", some being \"To what cities did characters travel?\" - Seriously? This is a gradschool level course. There are only 30 questions too so watching this movie and remembering this stuff was imperative. It felt like they ran out of things to ask.\n* The final is based on the entire semester so you have to study the whole damn course beforehand.\n* Exam is closed book so prepare to memorize equations.",

And maybe it's because of the nature of the form of dialogue, or it's purely lack of preparation, their languages are broken and not well organized that made it even harder to understand for someone whose mother tongue is not English. Watching the videos is a pain, I always had to search on Youtube for other tutorials on the same topic to understand what the professors were really talking about.

            "text": "Bottom line: Very challenging course, unprofessional TAs, unclear expectations on assignments.\n\nI took this course in the Fall of 2018.  I was really excited to take this course and based on the reviews from this site I knew it was going to be challenging.  I had no data science or ML experience before but I have a BS in Computer science.  However, I had to drop the course due to some life situations that didn't allow my full attention to the course.  \n\nThough I didn't want to drop the course, I am glad i did because it was out of my frame of knowledge and the learning environment was not enjoyable.\n\nThis was the sixth course I took in the OMSCS curriculum; Networks, info sec, Ed Tech, HCI, Soft Dev.  All of those courses were challenging in their own way but not impossible to complete for a student working full time to complete.  \n\nCS7641 was different compared to the courses i have taken in the following ways.\n1> Expects the student to have a solid/advanced understanding of ML topics.\n\n2> Does not walk the student slowly into the curriculum.  The first project gets you right into the material and there is extremely minimal guidance on what to do for the first project.   \n\n3> The lectures are as clear but fall short of explaining the topics succinctly.  The videos are lively but the extended amount of banter between the two professors draws out the videos and regularly I could not follow their train of thought.\n\n4> The TAs are not the best I've experienced.  The TAs interaction with the students is simply unprofessional.  Interactions between TAs and students on Piazza should be professional and there is no room for snide remarks when a student is asking a simple question.\n\nThis course is for you if you if you are experienced with ML topics and have worked with popular ML packages before.  If you really want to take this course without any prior ML knowledge I suggest you watch all the videos for the course on eDX or Udacity before taking the course and read the book for the class cover to cover.  This will save you time to struggle through the projects.\n\nIf you want an example of a professional and superbly taught OMSCS course take Educational Technology or HCI (anything taught by Dr. Joyner). \n",

            "text": "First let me start by stating that this is a hard course, no doubt. But the course is made harder by a disastrous lecture sequence. What the hell were they thinking when they made the insanely long and meaningless lecture videos. Watching the lectures were a pain and a torture. Too many pointless trash talking that throws one off. They should really learn from Andrew ng's course in coursera and how to make the videos relevant and to the point. Heck, the videos of ML4T is so good and the explanations were so concise and clear. On the contrary, in ML there were too many hand waving, lame jokes, out of context talks and over the air explanation that made no sense or too difficult to comprehend. If you solely relied on lectures for this course, you are destined to not only fail but do worse than not watching anything at all. Its that bad. Prof Isbell is a smart guy but arrogant. Don't dare to ask him any obvious questions or he will ruin your credit history (He joked this in one of his Piazza posts). His answers are always standard, I DON'T CARE. The ML office hours are absolutely a waste of time. The TAs handling the OH are students who have no clue what they are talking. At times they seem lost in explaining even the basic stuff. And the projects description is the biggest joke of all. No clear instructions at all. All it says is, steal the code, I don't care. But write a report. Really? Even the lamest of a description would be better than that. Piazza is a total chaos with questions from confused students and equally confusing explanation. I am sorry to rant but this is not a very well run course. If there is anything wrong with OMSCS, it would be the way this course is run. A perfect example of a poorly designed and mismanaged course. Unless they change the way it is run, this course will continue to see record churn. I hope something is done to fix this.\n\nP.S. I am taking this course in the fall of 2018 and this is how I felt half way through the course.",

            "text": "I actually took this class Fall 2018, it just wasn't available in the semester drop down.\n\nThis is absolutely the worst class I have ever taken in my life, and I'm not even done with it yet, though I may just withdraw soon. The old adage of research professors not caring about their classes is fully exemplified in this class. The professors main interaction with the students is to tell them that he doesn't care at all, about what they use for projects or how they do them. His flippancy carries over to the TAs, and thus piazza is a jumbled, awful mess. \n\nThe assigments are also awful. Instead of giving you anything to really go off, the class asks you to find some data set to use, and then re-use for all further assignments. If you, like me, don't really have any strong opinions or desire to explore any specific data, then this sucks! You wind up picking some random data sets, and then having to manufacture some problems for them, and then your lack of real interest in them shows through in the papers. In my opinion, no data set is really going to be that interesting, and if it is, then it probably can't be explored in the few weeks you have to do the assignment while also presumably working full-time. \n\nPerhaps this whole thing is being exacerbated also by the fact that I just got done taking Human-Computer Interaction with Dr. David Joyner, whose enthusiasm for teaching shows in every part of his course. He is a true professor, interested in interacting with and working with his students to ensure that they have a great learning experience. It could also be because I took Machine Learning for Trading two semesters ago with Dr. Balch (who is also a great professor), and that class had amazing assignments that were well thought out and provided you with a solid starting point for exploration and learning. Those assignments also came with expected results and test cases to check your work!\n\nI think this class could be fixed if they would give you the datasets and the code to run them. If all they really care about is the conclusions you draw from the results of running the code, then I think that would be the easiest thing to do. It would give them a stronger basis on which to grade things, because the data sets and results would be known, and it would free the students to really focus on the analysis, which is all that the class says that it wants. Even with that, they could still give you places to tweak the knobs if they really wanted to. There just is a big disconnect between what the professor says he wants and what the students actually need to do for the assignments.\n\nOf course, to fix it, the professors would have to care about it, and as mentioned above, they don't. \n \nIf you are interested in the topic, the videos are alright, and the book recommended, Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell, is quite good. However, the assignments really detract from the course overall, and so I would strongly recommend against taking it if you can help it. To the point where I will probably switch my specialization so I don't have to take it. ",

Not from the lectures only as stated in the previous feedback\n2. Projects are significantly tough. Add to the complexity, the wordings and some parts of the projects are frustratingly ambiguous \n3. Grading  projects takes a LOOONG time. Project 2 grades and feedback didn't come until project 4 is released, making it really hard for students to make a decision on whether to drop it or not. \n4. If you get the code completely working, you will get good grades. If it is partially working, expect to get close to nothing. \n5. Leaving out some of the instructions like uploading all the files everytime in canvas will result in 0 marks. In contrast, Other courses are okay with just uploading changed files and their autograder works fine. \n6. 10 hours per week is a really underestimated efforts. You should have been in the slack channel for project 2 or project 3 to see how many hours students put in. Each of them were well over 40 hours each. This is coming from someone that is half way in the program with a perfect GPA and have done well in many of the courses. \n7.

            "text": "\n\nThis is an amazing class. The heart of the class are the numerous and long projects which you need to start early. As one person put it: most classes are about the lectures and you have to fit in time to do the projects between lectures, **this class is about the projects**, you need to fit in some time to do the lectures between projects.\n\n**The lectures are very good**. The projects are fun, interesting, and relevant. They are also very well set up (unlike many courses in this program). The teaching staff is helpful to some degree, but I got the best experience by watching the Spring 2018 videos by Matt Houston which the TAs shared with us. That really enhanced the class and made the projects more doable.\n\nThere is some criticism that the material is no longer relevant in the era of Deep Learning. I disagree completely. While DL is useful for certain CV problems, CV is much more than that. Techniques like Kallman filters, Particle Filters, and general knowledge about image processing, homographies, and hough circles are as relevant today as they were in the past. In fact, **this class would be good prep for a DL class**.\n\nThe workload for this class is quite considerable. Expect to find yourself working on these projects for 20-40 hours. **Don't leave the project for one weekend. Its not enough.**\n\n**Final veredict**: Do this class.. the projects are great fun, you'll learn a lot. I highly recommend it. **Of all the classes of the program, this may very well be the best one** \n\n**Useful classes to take before this one**: I found Computation Photography was good prep for this class. Also some topics of AI for Robotics. If you've ever taken a Graphics class its helpful too because of all the linear algebra.\n",

I did have  natural advantage in this course in that I have worked in the finance sector building trading systems for sell side brokers + I had taken AI as my first course (so my comments on ease of course may be a bit harsh) \n\n I took this course because \n\n(1) I wanted an easy summer after taking AI - which was brutal in comparison \n\n(2) I wanted to learn a bit about practical application of ML in the upstream systems that feed the trading systems I work on in my day job\n\nEven without a background like mine I would say the course is extremely easy.  As others have commented some of the exam questions were farcical for a graduate level course and a number of the assignments involved little more than mechanically coding formulae or spoon fed descriptions of solutions given in lectures.   That said the course did provide a rgood general overview of how  buy side hedge funds operate and the  two main assignments did provide a bit more challenge.  \n\n\nIf you have limited financial or ML knowledge this course will provide you with a gentle and enjoyable introduction to both and it will supply you with good high level understanding of how financial markets operate.   However you are given  a very simplified view of the markets and it will not prepare you for dealing with any of complexities you would encounter with if you were trading in the real world.\n\nOverall  the course was fun and I did feel I learnt some useful things from the course (although a good bit less than I had hoped) \n\n I do feel that the difficultly was below that of a  graduate level course.and in my opinion the content and difficultly should be seriously increased.   More depth and challenging open ended projects would make this a very interesting and valuable course rather than an easy but enjoyable summer option that does not really live up to its potential\n\n\n\n",

Don't come in expecting to learn the standard C/Java like programming assignments. This is a new domain (was at least new for me). If you come in with that curiosity, you will enjoy this course. \n\nTeaching assistant team for this course is really good. Tohid is clearly passionate about this course and domain and does a fantastic job. \n\nCourse has three projects and 2 exams. Generally projects use non-traditional  protocols and technologies such as ladder logic, somachine, mininet, modbus, etc. So there is a ramp up time before every project. But the learning curve is not too steep. If you start early, you will do well.\n\nMedian for this course is quite high given that lot of people do well. There is also an extra credit assignment (Between 1 to 3 % points). So don't expect a curve for this course. \n\nPiazza for this course is probably the best organized one in the entire OMSCS program. Tohid creates a thread for every part of the project and all the discussions are generally captured in that one place. It is much better than wading through several threads of totally disorganized topics in some of the other courses. \n\nOffice hours are also recorded, which is another plus. \n\nPaper presentation was tried for the first time in this course in Fall 2018. It gives a very good exposure to a bunch of research topics on this field. If you are complaining about lack of an evaluation component in the first 4 weeks, here is one that you can pick. It is much easier to see a video done by one of the peer students for 20 minutes compared to reading through 40-50 research papers through the semester. ",

            "text": "The instruction lectures for HCI are relatively recent compared to some of the other OMSCS courses - this is great and shows how much GT's OMS program has evolved over time. Dr. Joyner was the professor during the Summer 2018 semester, and his interest and enthusiasm for the class and the program as a whole does carry through via weekly updates, the discussions he encourages on Piazza, and via the video lessons.\n\nThis class is a good introduction class and a bridge between elements of Computer Science and Human Psychology which is not something I've previously been exposed to in a single class at GT undergrad nor GT grad. I've taken CS classes and Psychology classes, but never anything that merged the two. \n\nIt's a course that is less technical and not focused on software or coding; instead, the class involves a lot of reading and writing. For many technical folks like myself, writing is hard and reading is slow, so be aware of that. Having some experience (novice level) with image manipulation or UI mockup tools is very helpful and fun. I now use these mockup & image editing tools in my day job. \n\nIf you took HCI as your first class in the OMS program, you might come away with the idea that all GT CS classes will be like this. Note that most classes expect more coding, strong programming skills, and \"traditional CS\" stuff. However, if you are taking HCI in between many of those \"traditional CS classes\", it is a breadth of fresh air because it is so different than a \"traditional CS class\". This is why I found it very enjoyable.",

As others have mentioned, they are extremely opaque and piddly - your only verification that they are meeting the course's test cases are a limited number of submissions per day with very little feedback surrounding that submission and little information surrounding what the test case even was. I will admit that C is not a language I'm particularly good at. I recommend becoming very competent with C prior to attempting this course. Additionally, the specific APIs in C - which are poorly documented wherever you go - become your worst enemy.\n\nPrior to withdrawing, lectures were about on par with what I remembered from my undergraduate-level OS courses. Overall, unless you're really interested in OS or need this for a requirement, I would skip it. The projects are honestly hugely frustrating and they don't need to be - a local testing framework which mirrored 90% of the autograder's test cases would have made this a much less piddly course.",

            "text": "**TL;DR: I regret taking this course.** There are far better courses available in OMSCS.\n*Warning: The instructor was not engaged in the course.* This course is taught by TAs and centered on projects run by TAs. *Expect rude responses on piazza.*\n\nRead the reviews! I regret not paying heed to the [negative] course reviews. As a veteran of several OMSCS courses, this was the worst. Despite the problems, I learned a lot about Network Security [lectures and readings], and couple of projects were enjoyable and worth the effort.\n\nNetwork Security has a reputation as being a less challenging course, but difficulty may be normalized. One way to increase difficulty would be to cover material in greater depth or expand covered material. The approach chosen by this course seemed to add work and make project descriptions indecipherable. Many OMSCS students have extensive IT experience, often in the practical tools used in this course. You need to learn Wireshark, Snort, web development, javascript, etc, to be successful.\n\nThe course lectures are an overview of the material; lecture notes are provided. Listen to the lectures and review the notes, as they introduce concepts. Most of the course content lies in the readings and the projects.\n\nThere were tons of readings between the papers (over 60), and books (penetration testing, bitcoin, etc).  Many of these readings were excellent, and clearly conveyed extensive information about security, although a few papers were undecipherable. One can try to discern which readings are important, and which less relevant. Since many readings are not relevant to the projects, quizzes or final, a less motivated student could skip 80% of the papers, avoid much of the knowledge presented in the course, and still earn an A or B.\n\nThere were five projects (80% of course grade). The projects were disconnected. Each approached a different aspect of network security. Project descriptions varied in quality, and ranged from clear and understandable (great) to undecipherable (terrible). The general impression is that the projects were a tragic mess.\n\nThe hardest part of the course was the struggle to puzzle out what was needed to succeed on the projects.  The TAs shared crucial information in office hours and on slack. Follow these channels as well as piazza, as a summary of slack/office hours are not provided on piazza.\n\nOne project was composed of two sub-projects. One part used regular expressions (literature consensus repudiates approach) and expected students to guess what patterns to detect. Another used javascript and iframe(s), and many students were unable to guess the trick. Many students did not guess how to perform parts, and the average was ~50%. Do not expect TAs to provide guidance, even after the project is completed.\n\nAnother project required students to detect malicious behavior in packet captures, learn snort, and construct rules to detect the patterns.  The project seemed more about finding needles in haystacks (malicious packets in captures), than learning how to effectively use snort as an IDS. Half of the points were a summary report from detected packet patterns. The all-or-nothing grading was harsh. Expect to request regrades.\n\nAnother project writeup specified one-one or one-many to perform blending attacks, but TAs announced that only one approach would gain full marks. Alternative solutions and critical thinking were not rewarded. The TAs announced rubric changes mid-project (read all piazza posts). Students were graded by different criteria depending upon when project submitted.\n\nSince TAs effectively taught the course, one relied upon TAs to provide a good experience. The tone of the TAs on piazza was generally rude and defiant (bordered on abusive), and the course was an unpleasant experience.\n\nThere were ten quizzes, open book & notes, extremely easy, but with specific open & close dates. Grading criteria changed mid-course from multiple attempts to single attempt. The quizzes were busy work and an exercise in time-management.\n\nThe final was cumulative, the questions were poorly phrased and tricky, and seemed more like trivia than exam. The result was the class average was an abysmal 67%. No discussion of final exam questions allowed, even though phrasing was poor.\n",

            "text": "This course taught by Prof. Ada is very well run. The lectures do a good job of explaining the material and Prof. Ada holds regular office hours to help clarify things. Her involvement was very helpful. The TAs were very good in this course as well, but grading was a bit slow. I took this as my second course in the program. I took it in the summer, so there were only 3 main projects instead of 4, and then there was a midterm and a final. There were also a few required papers to read. If you are comfortable with OS implementations and how they function and are comfortable writing in C, you could probably skip this class. But even though I had an undergrad OS class about 3 years ago, I found this course to be sufficiently challenging and I learned a lot from it.\n\nAll the projects are programming in C and they can take quite a bit of time to work through and debug, especially if you aren't super comfortable writing and debugging in C. The assignments were available  early enough to allow you to have enough time to work on them. The midterm and final are closed book and fairly difficult and are carefully worded to make sure you understand the material. But there is a generous curve in the class. If I remember correctly, somewhere in the low to mid 80s usually ends up being an A, and somewhere in the low to mid 60s ends up being a B. I would highly recommend this course and I think if you put in the work it's not too difficult to pass. ",

(as opposed to poorly written assignments, ambiguous questions, defensive TAs).\n\nThe midterm was one of the most challenging tests I've taken in my life (high-stakes arithmetic - literally pages after pages of number crunching, with no clue if you are doing it right), yet I loved every minute of it.  It probably taught me more than any homework.\n\nHomeworks are a typical 2-week project and are HARD.  You are given an algorithm, a research paper or two, and told basically ' have at it'.  Some algorithms are fun (game-playing), others are boring (mixed gaussian expectation maximization).  Fortunately there is skeleton code which makes it a 'fill in the blanks' deal, but they are some very big blanks.  A few assignments I put in 80+ hours, handed in right at the deadline, and immediately had to start the next assignment.  I was pretty burnt out.\n\nHowever, provided you put in the time in the readings and research, it's almost impossible to fail in this course.  Anything above the average grade is an A.  Anything over 90% is an A.  The lowest homework grade is dropped.  There are a TON of TAs, there are office hours every day (Don't expect quick answers on piazza, the threads run into thousands of posts), they seem to actually care to answer your questions (as opposed to the usual - 'implement the algorithm' answers), the lecture videos are nice (pretty girls help), you learn about shark bites - all in all a good time. \n\nHighly recommended, much better than KBAI, just be prepared to work.",

Its not a difficult class so you have time to acquaint yourself with all the different technologies used in OMSCS as well.  There is a group component to this class.  We filled out a survey and the instructor or TA's paired us up.  There are 3 group projects and 6/7 individual assignments.  There were no exams.  The class uses Java for all of the projects.  1 project was a very basic Android app.  You should at least have a basic understanding of Java so you can help your team in the projects.  The professor held weekly office hours and was actually pretty active on Piazza when I took this class.  In my opinion, I think this professor ranks as one of the top professors in the program.  He deserves a bit more recognition.  He has an ability to break thing down and make them seem so simple.  If you've been in development for very long, you realize how valuable that is.\n\nFor the experienced developers:\n\nIf you're already a software dev then you may find this course lacking new information to you.  If you still want to take this class even with experience, know that not everyone is on the same level as you.  This could be a chance to learn patients and leadership.  It may also be a good opportunity to gain some practice in mentoring people new to the field or subject.  Also, if worse comes to worse, and you end up on a team that doesn't contribute at all, all of the projects can be done by one experienced developer quite easily.  ",

I never had a formal intro to under-grad level algorithms prior to enrolling in this course.\n\nThe course covers in depth algorithms, ranging from Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, Graph algorithms, Linear programming, NP complete algorithms, various reductions to prove NP complete algorithms.  This is a great course to develop algorithmic thinking, which may help you in technical interviews.  And you only need to write pseudo-code, use algorithms as a black-box to solve specific problems and perform analysis of algorithms.  So no coding except on the project.  You only need to write less than 100 lines of code (take this with a grain of salt, I gave the number just as an idea) in total for the course\n\nI spent a lot of time playing catch up.  For example, I didn't know how graphs are represented, basic algorithms for graph traversal/exploration, finding shortest path using Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford algorithm etc.  So, if you're in the same boat as me and are really interested in taking the course, I'd suggest taking only this course, and maybe even starting ahead with dynamic programming and revising graphs.\n\nThere was one project which consisted 10% of the grade.  I roughly spent about 13-15 hours on this.  If you spend enough time on it, you should be able to ace it an get the entire 10% of the grade.  We had roughly 1 homework assignment per week.  They account for an insignificant portion of the grade (5%), but are strongly recommended to do as practice problems for the exams.  The problems you'll see in the exams are very similar to HW problems.  The only change I'd like to see in the course is to have one more mid term (total 3 mid terms and one final).  Due to weight-age of the exams, if one screws up a mid term, then they may be looking at a lower grade.  \n\nFinally, a special shout out to the TA's for this course in Fall 2018.  They were very helpful answering all the questions in Piazza and slack.  Very diligent in grading the assignments and mid-terms.  The course had close to 450 (prior to withdrawal date) students.  The turn around time for grading the projects and the mid terms (both mid terms were prior to withdrawal date) was just one week.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic course, great learning, helpful students and TA's.  I really developed a new way to approaching problems, in general.  Grade doesn't matter, learning does!  So I'm satisfied and would absolutely recommend this course to anyone.  Just prepare yourself for spending ample time and learning :)",

First OMSCS class, with background in statistics/applied ML\n\nThis course delivers what it promises, a whirlwind tour of machine learning topics. Very rewarding experience, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Like with most things, you get what you put in.\n\nI enjoyed the lectures, Littman and Isbell build up the theory empirically which is great to build intuition however not as efficient when rushing through the lectures at the last minute studying for an exam. My thoughts are to watch these lectures early, take notes and use the notes/lecture transcripts as the main focus of study for exams. Re-watch lectures to reinforce certain topics.\n\nHaving some background knowledge in ML is very beneficial, use Andrew Ng’s Machine learning course on Coursera as complementary material.\n\nStart the assignments early! Don’t wait until the last week. On paper it seems like you have a lot of time per assignment, but understanding the API/code, running the experiments, understanding and explaining results takes time. I enjoyed the open ended assignments as it provided more room to explore.  \n\nDue to the structure of the assignments, consistency in grading can be an issue in the MOOC format, (Isbell does have a generous curve to help alleviate this). That being said, I really liked the report format of the assignments, writing them helped solidify concepts.\n\n\nSome TA’s are very good and active on forums, others are lower energy but they do hold a group office hours every week and take questions. Do attend/watch these as they provide solid guidance for assignments.\n\nDo not stress too much about grades, put in the effort, do your due diligence and you will be fine. Its a tough course but looking back its been a lot of fun.\n",

Projects are useless without learning anything from them. Hope everyone can skip this course. Compared to this course, David Silver's Reinforcement Learning is way better.\n\nTA's are pretty bad. A lot of them are just undergraduate students who have never gone to graduate school. (I checked their linkedin profiles and found that.) They are extremely unprofessional and not capable of grading and understanding your project, nor they are clear about the objective of the project. Many of them probably never read or know how to read research papers or do research. You will get very frustrated working with them.\n\nOverall, be very careful of this course. Probably like in a pitfall of some waste. Totally waste time and money to take it. Skip this course definitely.",

You will have 3 challenging but very rewarding projects in the class; 2 where you will reproduce seminal RL papers, and another Deep RL project. It's hard work but very rewarding and you will learn a ton. There are also 6 homework assignments that are challenging but well designed to drive home some understanding of the material. Unless you are experienced in ML, I would recommend taking this class after ML4T (where you will get an intro to numpy, pandas, and RL) and DVA. You may also want to do ML first, which also provides an intro to RL for the last 1/3 of the class. You probably don't want to pair this class with another.\n\nThe TAs in this class are the best I've seen in the entire OMSCS program. They understand the material thoroughly (many work in RL, one is writing a book for Manning), they understand the expectations for each homework assignment and project, and they put a lot of extra effort into the class. Each office hour is run very smoothly and well attended (both students and TAs). Usually, one TA will provide a brief overview of what you should be working on, and then usually a little talk about some of the material. There were also some extra study sessions conducted to try and help students with homework and prep for projects. Questions on Piazza are answered clearly and promptly. I've found the grading be fair and objective. They also tend to jump in a lot on the Slack channel (which has been a lot of fun). \n\nBottom line; this is a great class with instructors who care about the subject and want to help others learn it. It is a lot of work, but it's also very rewarding. You will learn a lot! And RL is awesome.",

I personally think that is way more useful for a degree-based program, as you will develop a critical understanding of the subject matter, rather than mastering how to use tools that could be picked up in your spare time on your own anyway.\n\nThe TAs are very helpful!  Also, piazza tended to be fairly quiet, but the slack channel was very active, including TAs.\n\nThe comments on the projects and homeworks in previous comments are pretty accurate.  You get them in batches, with the deadlines staged across a month, but you shouldn't wait to start the project after the two homeworks' deadlines have passed.  Start early, because just like ML, you could work on the projects forever if you really wanted to.\n\nIf you don't have experience with linear programming, take GA before this.

I work with data and found the material very easy yet unnecessarily time-consuming (read: busywork) and learned little from lectures or homework. I picked a project I was interested in for my group and got some value out of this (doing most of the work myself, as these things go). \n- Lectures are very high-level and brief \n- Homeworks are either extremely detailed (D3.js - legend three px to left, etc) or all over the place (hello world on AWS & Azure using five different tools). With prior experience, they take 1-2 days at most and are an easy A with some attention to detail. The downside is, of course, you'll also not learn much. Without experience, you may spend several days on each project to climb up the learning curves without really getting very far. \n- The group project should bring everything together but student backgrounds are diverse so it's worth selecting a group carefully. Lots of people dropped half-way through.\n\nIf you want to dive deep into data science and spend time on an ambitious project, the course gives you a platform. If not, you may ask yourself, as I do, what the point of this class is.",

            "text": "This course serves as an introduction to network security. The vast amount of the frustration comes from one project that needs to be upgraded. Specifically, the autograder requires an obsolete approach to be used that makes a solution require 20-30 hours for 25% of the project grade rather than 1-2 hours. No one simply wants to make the effort to upgrade that project and the course to the level of AI or CV. I shared in the frustration but I have experienced the same in SAT so I can't single out this course as being especially awful. The quizzes require careful reading but are pretty easy points. The difficulty of quizzes and tests are exactly like IIS. \n\nI would only recommend this to students who are brand new to network security due to the broad range of topics covered. The depth and projects are nowhere near the cutting edge and won't be helpful to anyone with experience in this field. To those new students, I also recommend a minimum of 8 GB of RAM for the virtual machines that have to be run for the virus analysis. My old 6 GB computer had the absolute minimum required to complete the assignment.  ",

This course serves as an introduction to data manipulation with Python and Pandas and an introduction to a few basic machine learning concepts. If you have taken AI or CV before this one, then the projects will require no new learning with python at all except maybe how to graph data for some specific requirements. Similarly, you will not learn any meaningful depth if you have taken ML beforehand. Anyone gauging their interest into trading and financial software would benefit from this course. Anyone with experience with applying machine learning to trading will not learn anything new in this course.\n\nIn terms of structure, the course starts with simple projects manipulating data in Python. These projects become modules in later learning agents before using everything at the end when applying machine learning to choose trades and make money. Therefore, this class is one of the easiest to complete work ahead of time with only minor changes once the project requirements are finalized. The midterm and final are easy multiple choice exams.",

            "text": "This course serves as a great introduction into the theory and actual practice of machine learning. I came into this course having no experience with ML whatsoever and was able to succeed with the course format. The majority of the work centers around four assignments on different ML fields. Students are given 5 weeks for the first topic and assignment to help learn the format with 3 weeks given for the remaining assignments. Each assignment gives you the freedom to choose your own data or problems. Then the student can cite and use any implementation of the four assignments to produce the results. These assignments will make you go through the painful learning process of cleaning data, balancing data, setting up pipelines, visualizing data, and analyzing the results. All of these steps are a part of actually using these techniques in research and business. Students are evaluated completely on their ability to understand and explain the results in a 10 to 12 page report with no points for implementation. I spent from 30-50 hours on each assignment to go from learning the technique to completing the report.\n\nThe four topics are supervised learning, randomized optimization, unsupervised learning, and Markov decision processes. The lectures are great at building the foundation of the approach, biases, strengths, and weaknesses of the different techniques. The midterm and final then evaluate the student's ability to understand these traits of each approach to then decide which algorithm would be the most appropriate given a specific problem. Grading largely depends on being able to explain the \"why\" of your approach and implementation format and the \"why\" your learners performed the way they did. You will not receive points for simply using 12 pages to list the observations that you see on your graphs or tables, which also serves as a point of frustration for some students. Grades are significantly curved such that over 90% of students who do not drop receive a B or higher.\n\nAll of the \"I don't care\" rants on this review board refer to Dr. Isbell having to repeatedly tell students that he does not care about what language or software you use to implement the ML techniques. This class has a lot of flexibility which tends to frustrate those students who have the expectation that every little detail needs to be outlined as the definition of \" a great learning experience.\" Dr. Isbell also loves sarcasm which some students cannot understand or do not like, which leads to a lot of the \"unprofessional\" comments on here.\n\nOverall, this course can teach you the practical and theoretical foundation for ML if you are willing to actually work for it.\n\n",

If you aren't familiar with java, do yourself a favor and study up on it before the course.  This course gives you a great opportunity to learn some java, learn how to use piazza, canvas, github, work with a team remotely, and just get the essence of OMSCS.  \n\nThe first couple of assignments were straight forward and easy to complete.  Once we started working with Android Studio, I had to do a lot of research to see how it worked, but was able to complete assignments working less than 10 hours a week.  This time requirement went up with the individual project.  I had a good group and our app was fully functional, but we put a lot of time and effort into it, up to 15 hours a week.  I spent some extra time on the final project in an attempt to earn some extra credit.\n\nTasks are assigned and collected on a weekly basis.  There is one assignment/deliverable each week.  They are due on Friday 12AOE, which is Saturday 7am EST.  There were no extensions and they will not release assignments early.  Be ready to work each week.  Professor & TA's are very active on piazza and hold a weekly office hour on YouTube Live.  Assignments were sometimes easy and sometimes challenging, but I was always able to confidently submit my assignments (except the uml diagram, but I got a 100).  \n\nDon't expect grades to be returned in a timely manner.  It took upwards of 3 weeks to a month to get grades back, though the grading always seemed fair, and they honor grade challenges.  ",

            "text": "This is my first course in the OMSCS program. I have a background in Java from undergrad and write C/C++ code daily for work. This review will be based on that experience.\n\nThis class has 4 projects, 10 quizzes, and 2 tests. The quizzes are easy, and the tests are pretty hard. \n\nProject 1 - PR 1 was on a VM using C code. Some say that this project was the hardest, but for me this project was pretty simple. It was asking about buffer overflow exploiting and concepts similar to this. The write up for this project is tough. Make sure you leave out no details and truly explain what is going on.\n\nProject 2 - PR2 was a little different. For PR2 you opened up a VM and ran some malware that was given to you. You then have to read through the execution of it and figure out which malware was triggered and which wasn't. Sounds easy enough? Wrong, many of the people in this Fall 2018 class did terribly on this assignment because the criteria for executing or not executing is not very clear. My advice, work with some classmates and talk about each exploit 1 by 1.\n\nProject 3 - PR 3 was pretty cool. You got to play with some RSA cryptography stuff. This project is written 100% in Python 3. This project does take some time and have some major GOTCHA's but with some due diligence, this project can be finished quickly and you will actually enjoy it. \n\nProject 4 - PR4 for me was the toughest. You were doing things like XSRF attacks, sql injection, and things similar to phishing. Have 0 experience in HTML, PHP, or JS, I found this project to be extremely difficult. Others did not. \n\nTest 1 & 2 - I HATE reading text books, but for these tests, I highly suggest that you at least follow along in the text book while the lecture is going on. I took test 1 using ONLY the lecture and got less than a 70. STUDY THE BOOK FOR THE EXAMS.\n\nQuizzes - If you read the lecture notes or even studied the book a little bit the quizzes will be a breeze.\n\nThe TA's for this semester were FREAKING AWESOME. They are absolutely helpful if you ask the right questions. The teacher was not around much, but the TA's for this class this semester from what I heard were the best anyone has had in any class so far. Kudos to them.\n\nOVERALL:\nI would definitely say this was a semi-good opener for the OMSCS program. I HIGHLY suggest that you start working on the projects soon after they are released. This will keep you up to date with all the people in the slack channel. OH, JOIN THE SLACK CHANNEL. It will make life so much easier. There were discussions on the daily about the projects and the best plan of attack. Once in a while you will even see someone slip and release a bit of information that wasn't supposed to be released. JOIN THE SLACK CHANNEL.\n\nBit of advice: As stated at the top, C/C++ are my strong suit so I helped a lot of my fellow students with Project 1. When it came time for project 2, it was nice to have people to compare thoughts with about the Malware. Helped me get a high grade on the project. Then those same people when project 3 came around were there to bounce ideas and strategies off as well. Finally in project 4 where I struggled the hardest, I had people willing to help me understand because I had made friends with them and helped them along the way.",

This course has some times where you may not have much work to do, and other weeks where you can spend 30-40 hours trying to do a project. The lectures themselves are very very dry and Sebastian Thrun (the main instructor) does a terrible job of relaying material and concepts beyond the first lecture. The projects can be very confusing on what needs to be done, and expect to spend lots of time debugging the issues. I want a disclaimer that I got a high A in this course, so I am not just some disgruntled student  but I was very unhappy with the execution. If I had to say one positive thing about this course, the TA's were pretty quick and helpful. ",

Probably yes.\n- Have you been writing lots of small code snippets for online courses, but don't know exactly how you'd be able to work with other software engineers to build a larger software system? This course is for you.\n- At what other point in your life would you be forced to write about the merits (or demerits) of different programming paradigms?\n\nDisclaimer: I haven't taken SDP so I'm not sure how the content of this class differs in scope and usefulness.\n",

The material was produced by Sebastian Thrun, who narrates the videos. Thought he was awesome, given his on-the-ground expertise in the field. Dr Thrun did office hours several times, which was \"really, really great\" (as he likes to say). The instructor for the course -- Dr Jay Summet -- was great as were the TA's. Both were super responsive. The forums were super helpful as was the Slack channel. In terms of the material itself, it's really AI-lite in as much as the focus is on entry-level algorithms used in self-driving vehicles -- actual AI/ML is outside the scope of this course. I feel like I learned quite a number of really interesting algorithms -- Kalman filters, Particles filters, A star, Theta star, PID, SLAM. The assignments were all fairly straight forward, except the very first one -- Runaway Robot -- which I found very challenging. I would suggest getting through the first few sections of the course straight away, and start work on Runaway immediately.  \n\nSo you can assess my review appropriately, I have 15+ years of software engineering experience across the stack. I am super comfortable with learning new frameworks/languages, and researching things I don't understand. I have a partial CS undergraduate degree. ",

It takes a lot of energy and effort for each question to come to the correct answer (setting up software/coding environments, learning many different coding languages on the fly, constantly checking Piazza 24/7 for TA corrections/clarifications and adjusting your code to reflect these changes, etc). \n\nBy the time you (sort of) figure out what you are doing and have all these moving pieces working together to get the correct answer and start making steam, you take that massive pot of saturated water with a ton of latent energy that you baked into it over 10-20 hours, AND THEN YOU DUMP IT DOWN THE DRAIN AND START ALL OVER FOR THE NEXT QUESTION. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA. \n\nRinse and repeat this over another dozen times or so and this is DVA. By the way, this doesn't include the team Project which is also adds another 100 hours to the course. \n\nSeriously, the course really needs to focus on a sub portion of all the materials it discusses, and less on busy work. Really, I think the course could focus almost entirely on HW2 (which is Javascipt, d3, HTML, CSS) and still be a pretty work intensive course if you know very little about front end web programming (which seemed to be the case for most the class). At least then I would have the confidence to be able to place those concentrated skills on my resume. As the class stands now, I touched so many things at once at such a high level, I really can't talk about them at an SME level within an interview. \n\nThis asks a basic but very critical question for the future design of the course: In terms of my career and the ability to market skills gained from this class, have I really gotten anywhere 300 hours later?\n",

All topics are taught around the concept of a self-drivng vehicle.  The projects are the highlight of the course and main source of learning.  The projects are very well constructed, challenging, and quickly reviewed.  \n\nPython is the language de jour in AI4R.   I tried to use NumPy as much as possible while not required.  I would not take this course without some Python background although its an easy language to pick up.  It would be nice if the projects were designed for C++ given that is the predominant language in the industry.\n\nThe instructor, Dr Jay Summet, was very active on Piazza as were the TA's.  The course is well organized and coordinated.  Dr Sebastian Thrun, who originally developed the material for the course, does some offices hours which is neat, but not directly useful for the courses.  He is a good lecturer but I don't like how many quizes are built into the Udacity lectures.  \n\nAdvice for the course, work ahead on the lessons, allocate 40+ hours for each project, and take advantage of the hardware challenges, as much as you have time.\n\nI highly recommend this course for anyone with a mild interest in robotics.",

            "text": "# Instructor Turnover\n\nIn the Summer of 2018, the original instructor (who had recorded the video lectures) had moved on, and a new instructor was just starting. This led to some minor discrepancies between the videos and the exams/project materials.\n\nThe head TA was a bit defensive, which led to some Piazza drama, as well.\n\n# Project Teams\n\nThe most stressful aspect of the course, though, was the beginning, getting a project team together. The project was roughly a third of the course grade, and the anxiety about getting a high quality team was pretty high.\n\nSlack and email were more effective than the Piazza exchange for finding teammates. I ended up with an excellent team, and we all did good work, pulling our own weight.\n\n# What I Learned\n\nI learned a ton about relational databases, SQL, git, GitHub, and the Vue framework.\n\n# Biggest Gap\n\nThe course is 100% focused on the \"back end\" of database design and construction. The project, however, had a significant requirement to have a user interface. It was stated that the user interface could be minimal, but our team took it as an opportunity to learn about front end development, as well.\n\n# What I'll Have to Look Up Later\n\nAll of the different forms of normalization.\n\n# What Students Complained About The Most\n\n\"Why isn't this a 'modern' database class?\"\nAnswer: Because relational databases still run the world, and a solid foundation in RDBMS is an awesome place to start when understanding more 'modern' database concepts.\n\n\"Why aren't the project requirements...[fill in complaint here]?\"\nAnswer: Because requirements definition is literally the most difficult part of creating a database. If anything, the students should have had an assignment where they write a requirement and another student has to implement, providing feedback on the requirement after the experience.\n\n\"The Piazza posts are insane\"\nAnswer: Piazza got to upwards of 1000 posts, each with dozens of replies and counter-replies. It was truly unmanageable.\n\n# What They Did Well\nThis instructor and TAs were lightning quick in Piazza responses, and honestly tried to address questions and complaints. They were willing to update items brought up in feedback.\n\n",

Some people who are relatively \"green\" will suffer long hours of struggling. Many people lost points because they didn't read the assignment text carefully enough. \n\nI went in knowing really only python and a little bit of SQL, and I did well in the class. The projects don't really go too in depth and provide usually only a cursory look at each technology/tool - though that's usually enough to get you going on more complicated pursuits. Note that you'll need to set up an AWS & Azure account using a credit card.\n\nBe aware that the group project is 50% of the grade and intermediate deliverables are due throughout the semester. If you are bad with time management, and/or dislike group projects - you should stay far away from this course. We had a passable group of partners (they recommend 4-6), but some groups had complete meltdowns where the majority of the group dropped out of the course or just decided not to participate anymore - which is standard stuff for any OMSCS group project class. Also, if you dislike web development work, the largest project in this class is a d3.js project that takes a relative large chunk of time.\n\nAside from these caveats, I greatly enjoyed the class and got quite a lot out of it.

I'm not sure how they expect someone to think very deeply about certain topics by watching a 5 minute video on it.  The level of nuance that is expected to parse some of the test questions is insane to me.  The homework assignments don't seem to align at all with the tested material (except for one question on the final exam which asked you to specify R functions you would use in certain situations).  They also pretty much give you all the code anyway, so I'm not sure how useful the homework assignments are in the first place.  The peer review process is hit or miss.  \n\nThe range of quality of TA responses is also all over the charts from just giving you a link and telling you to further research it or providing a detailed response.\n\nThe TAs were flexible with assignments -- I knew I would be out of town one week far in to the course, so I planned ahead with them in order to be able to submit the homework on time.\n\nAnd no, I didn't get a bad grade in the course, so I'm not just complaining because I did not do well.",

I have an MS in this field, have worked in this field for years, and literally was not able to complete Project 2 at all.  I earned 100% or close to it on all the other projects, but that project has the most absurd set of requirements I have ever seen.\n\nDisregard everything the syllabus or anything else says about the course requirements or prerequisites.  You need an expert level knowledge of Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Chrome extension development, executable disassembly in Linux and Windows, radare2, ida pro, ANGR, SNORT, Wireshark, and machine learning just to do the projects -- and you won't have time to get it if you don't.  Each of the projects would be either a full semester or 1/2 semester course at any other school -- and the course makes absolutely no attempt to teach you any of the things you need to know in order to complete any of them.  The teaching philosophy is \"go read the papers the professor wrote\".  The lectures are a high level overview of small pieces of the information you need, but make no attempt to actually get into detail on anything -- they're completely useless.  In fact, they remind me of CIS101 type lectures in terms of their depth.  Additionally, the projects are so poorly defined that they have to be continually questioned and re-questioned to get some idea of what the TAs are actually looking for.  \n\nAnd the quizzes.  Everyone's favorite.  If you've ever taken a Comptia test, this is equivalent.  Not in difficulty, in the requirement to memorize obscure (and often incorrect) bits of useless information hidden deep in the depths of 10+ year old research papers in order to find the least incorrect answer in the confusing mess of distractors.  Each quiz violates every principle of multiple choice exam development, using the most confusing language possible to artificially inflate the difficulty.  *Every* question is a trick question.  \n\nThe professor and the TAs?  Dismissive, don't care, basically tell the students to go jump in a lake any time questions they don't like are raised.  That's the only time the absentee professor shows up, in fact, is to berate students whose questions he doesn't like.  \n\nFinal exam?  Well, they pretend it's not *exactly* a final by omitting two lectures from the lecture list for the final, so that they can make it required outside of the final exam timeframe required by the university.  It's the kind of technicality a lawyer would love, I suppose.  And they use proctortrack, and they require you to use a mirror to show the rest of the room around you, and threaten to give you a zero on the exam if they can't see your mirror scan well enough -- and you can't re-do the mirror scan, and you can't see the mirror scan in the 1\"x1\" display in proctortrack, so there's no way to know if you did it well enough.  Multiple requests to show the room with the webcam or rotate the laptop around were ignored or answered with \"use a mirror\".  The course is actually more focused on anti-cheating than it is on teaching the material -- which is a shame because the course subject is a very interesting subject, and if taught well this would be a premiere course in this program.  ETA:  Well, the final is finished and graded.  Class-wide, we identified over 20 of the 35 questions as being incorrect, contradictory, or otherwise broken.  They didn't publish the class average, but based on the industry professionals in the course, my guess is the average was less than 40%.  We'll see what final grades are when they're posted.\n\nThis course is a dumpster fire.  I would not recommend that anyone ever take it.  ",

On the other hand, the group project was a massive pain in the ass, and I don't really understand the rationale for doing a group project in an online distributed graduate program. In particular it was quite challenging when certain group members contributed variable amounts to the project, and I ended up feeling like our project frankly would have been better done by one or two people - at higher quality, likely less total time, and certainly less stress than was achieved by doing it in a group.\n\nAt times I felt like Polo, the professor this term, was being super arbitrary in his interpretation of various rules and policies. Additionally, one ding on the homework assignments is that they required lots of environment configuration time, particularly relative to the actual core concepts. On one homework, I probably spent several hours configuring the cloud environment to run my MapReduce code, which I had written in something like < 5 minutes. Very very tedious and not that fun.\n\nOverall I wouldn't advise people to stay away from this course, but would certainly have them going in with eyes open. The homework assignments can take a long time if you don't go in with a great handle on JavaScript, and the group project is no fun. But it's an okay course overall, and I'm sure there are far worse in the program (at least the teaching team is engaged and seems to care quite a lot).",

This class is very good.  The videos are well done and the textbooks and extra readings (and yes generally you actually do need to read them) are well chosen.  The class is basically 4 homework assignments that are each 10 to 12 page papers and two exams.  Even if you can quickly and efficiently generate the models needed, writing the analysis (the only part that is graded) take a while especially if you want a good grade.  The exams are hard but fair.  The videos combined with the readings do a good job of conveying difficult topics and I found the banter between the professors to be entertaining.\n\nThe biggest issues I found with this class were on the administrative side.  The TAs ask that you send them questions ahead of office hours but they don't actually read any of the questions before office hours leading to a fair amount of \"we'll get back to you\" some prep on their end could have made office hours more effective. The administration of the mid term was also a mess with people not being able to access the exam initially.  Grading on everything is slow so be prepared wait and since everything is hand graded there is unevenness in the grading across graders.  \n\nI came into this class knowing a little about ML and I found this class to be a lifestyle.  The homeworks can basically take as much time as you have available to pour into them.  I learned so much by doing them, but by the end of the semester I was just completely worn out.  This class just never let up from a workload perspective.  The nice thing is that almost everyone gets a B or better in the class so I never found the class all that stressful, just exhausting.  ",

I listened to the advice of others and went through CS 1301x prior to taking this class, which was extremely helpful. If you aren't up on your Python, you need to do this. The course does a great job introducing you to the Python structures & tools that are used in data science.\n\nThe tests are the hardest part (24-36 hour windows) and I spent 12+ hours on the first two. If you are better at coding, it will be faster. Stack Overflow and you will develop a close relationship during the exams. Homeworks are not too bad, but the exams are harder, so try to do some reading on the side and actually understand the concepts of the homework rather than just finishing the notebooks. If you put in consistent hours throughout the semester, the class is do-able. Be mentally prepared to put the time in. ",

            "text": "Overall I though this was a good course. It demanded a large amount of work, but I do feel as though I got out what I put in. The first and last project revolved around implementing research papers. The middle project was based on the LunarLander OpenAI Gym environment. I'd describe the projects as such.\n\n* P1 [Whitepaper Implementation]: Relatively straightforward, implementable using simple logic. Read the paper carefully (probably more than once), but all the information is there.\n* P2 [OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander]: Straightforward, difficult to implement, computationally intensive to find the right hyperparameters (your code may be right... but still fail if you don't have the right hyperparameters). Online sources are helpful.\n* P3 [Whitepaper Implementation]: Extremely difficult, linear programming required, not documented online at all, so there really isn't any external source to lean on. Utilize the TAs heavily for this project in office hours... you'll need them.\n\nDifficulty: P3 > P2 > P1\n\nHomeworks: Easier of course than the projects and they help build the fundamentals. They provide immediate feedback which is nice. \n\nTAs: ridiculously excellent. BlueJeans is really nice for office hours. All the TAs are very helpful and are active on Slack a lot (and Piazza of course). The supplementary Linear Programming office hours that was done was very helpful and \"above and beyond\" what most TAs would be expected to do.\n\nProfessor: Prof Isbell was fairly absent from this course. The TAs ran it very well, so perhaps that's reflective of his confidence in them.\n\n Lectures: Leave a bit to be desired. Apparently they were done in 2015, and RL has been getting a lot of love since then. They may need an update. This is more a reflection of the current progress that's been made in the industry than an issue with the professors. The lectures are a bit proof/math heavy which isn't my thing... but I didn't personally commission the lectures myself, so it's hard to complain that they are addressing a wider audience.",

            "text": "**My background**: Majored in Mechanical Engineering, knew how to code,  but by no means an expert, best language python, never coded in Java or Android Studio before\n\n**My thoughts on this class**: Sometimes I felt like I wasn't learning much, and the weekly assignments were a lot to deal with. You have one week exactly per assignment, and no more, which for me made this class tough to pair with another. As soon as I finished an assignment for SDP, I'd try to work on class 2, but wait! There's already another assignment due for SDP. That said, it's a solid first course to get into the groove of the program, I did learn some stuff about, well, the software development process.\n\n**Class Structure**: \n- Weekly assignments, due on Friday nights. (Saturday 5am in California Time)\n- 1 group project that spans 3-4 weeks, a part due each week. 3-4 people/group. Involves building a simple app with Android Studio. Having never done this before (but having made a few *very simple* iPhone apps), I found it to be not that bad. I dislike Android Studio, but I managed. Toughest thing in the whole class is implementing a database on Android Studio for the group project, but thankfully someone else in our group did this. Documentation is important for group project. \n- All other assignments are weekly and done individually. Instructions are very clear and must be followed to the letter, in a sometimes annoying but ultimately helpful way. All assignments are very doable for novice coders. If you can make an if-else statement, you can pass this class. Having never coded in Java before, I survived, though with a healthy dislike of how Java deals with Strings!\n\n**Final Thoughts**: \n- Good first class. Take this class first, and don't pair it with another class. The weekly assignments makes the pace of two classes too stressful. Also I didn't like that the assignments were released Saturday morning because I don't have access to a printer at home. I would drive to work on Saturdays to print. Not fun. \n-Sometimes I felt like I wasn't learning anything, but only later did all the assignments come together. Overall glad I took this class to bring me up to speed on a lot of CS terminology I wasn't previously aware of (White/Black box testing, UML diagrams, etc). As I transition from mechanical engineering to CS work, I'm finding the terms I learn in class constantly pop up. Ergo, this class is doing something right. \n-Watch the videos a week earlier than listed on the syllabus so you immediately know what that week's assignment is about.\n-Teacher + TA's were great, always on Piazza. \n- If not for the weekly assignments, I'd pair this class with another one. I tried to, but ultimate dropped it because of the frantic nature of weekly assignments. Maybe double up the assignments and give everyone two weeks to do it?",

If I didn't know Python, this would have been much more difficult for me. The projects are basically due every 2 weeks, all the test material is given at the beginning of the semester; the only thing you can't work ahead on is the projects. The TAs are extremely responsive and attentive, which is a huge advantage as the professor is non-existent. Stacia was the head TA for the first half of the course, and like others said, she runs a tight ship and doesn't take attitude from anyone (and seems to be overworked), but that worked with my personality style so I had no issues. Halfway through, she was replaced and the other TAs had to scramble to cover the workload Stacia previously covered. The other TAs did a great job carrying the course to completion and worked extremely hard. Most of the topics are interesting, the projects are really captivating IMO, but the readings are pretty boring. Overall, good class and wonderful TAs -- the class would have been a disaster without them.  ",

Although I liked the class, I decided to withdraw in late Oct when it became clear I was unlikely to get a final grade of \"B.\" \n\nFor non-traditional students like myself with a steeper Computer Science / python learning curve, I recommend finding the \"easiest\" two classes to start with, regardless of specialization area, to improve the chances that you will successfully complete two foundational classes with a B or better in your first 12 months.\n\nProfessor Summet & his TAs were helpful and engaged in trying to help students over the humps. My main complaint in this course was that .. even after projects were graded, they still would not share code solutions. I got a 50% on one of the early projects (which was fair because I did not grok how-to translate the approach into working code at the time). However, even after getting that poor final project grade, they still would not share code solutions. It seems to me there should be a middle-road to show students what they did wrong without resulting in professors having to develop new projects from scratch every ~four months.\n\nLastly, I'd like to share the office hour links .. Dr Thrun's comments are all excellent, but in particular his remarks on the relevance of some portions of this current AI4R course really should be reviewed by students considering this class in the future. He makes great recommendations for additional (or even alternative) educational opportunities in the autonomous vehicle arena.\n\nOffice Hour Week 15 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2v77_zTQtE\n\nDr. Sebastian Thrun Office Hour\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82zUf32flMs\n\nOffice Hour Week 14\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaIGjD4HY8M\n\nOffice Hour Week 13\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-rjspBWoRI\n\nOffice Hour Week 12\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aXtJTqwyvI\n\nDr. Sebastian Thrun Office Hour\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMkLwYe1GZ8\n\nOffice Hour Week 10\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK0XX2kjHAc\n\nDr. Sebastian Thrun Office Hour\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KRHwFGE_xY\n\nOffice Hour Week 8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6J7dk2TApw\n\nOffice Hour: Wek 7\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTxpeVYZpU\n\nOffice Hour: Week 6\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EqofDEngA0\n\nOffice Hour: Week 5\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtc7XFUCo7M\n\nOffice Hour: Week 4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNrumNzuADg\n\nOffice Hour: Week 3\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeXOFeyOG8\n\nOffice Hour: Week 2\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7zHYxJQK4",

I did not take ML before this class, so picking up on some of the ML ideas was difficult. Second, the lectures aren't that great. Littman and Isbell have great chemistry, but a lot of the time, the importance or central idea of a concept is not clearly explained (sometimes terms aren't even defined), and is covered up in a lot of snark, which while amusing, does not help elucidate a lot of the topics. David Silver lectures should be used to supplement your understanding.\n\nHW's are way easier than the projects. The projects are pretty brutal, but overall enjoyable. Make sure you have extra time to do them, especially Project 2, the Lunar Lander.\n\nThe final is garbage, but that's true of most OMSCS classes. There's really no idea what concepts are going to be focused on in the exam, and there's a ton of lectures, so it's easily possible to be asked a question about something you barely even focused on because it didn't seem that important. I understand the need for an exam like this to encourage students to watch the lectures, but they just aren't a really good gauge of how much you understand, so be sure to boost your grade up by doing well on the projects.\n\nOverall, TA's were fantastic, and professor wasn't very involved, which is pretty much the norm in OMSCS.",

The homework and exams were difficult (homeworks took me 5-8 hours per week and exams took me 10 hours on average) but I think they were the best part. They didn't force you to memorize anything. You needed to do real work - interpret the problem, research, plan a solution, debug, etc. You could submit as many times as you wanted within the time restriction. This is why the homework and exams took so long but, if you were willing to put in the work, you can get an A. It was really satisfying to put that much time into an exam (midterm 2 took me the longest: 14.5 hours) and finish with 100.  \n\nOne negative thing - I didn't find the lectures added a ton of value. They were typically about 30 minutes long each week but they were just there to set up the basics of the homework. The homework is what really taught me. \n\nStill, this was an excellent course.

Prof. Thrun does a great job of explaining the mathematical aspects of the content in a very intuitive way. However, the actual mathematics is not delved into deeply. Diving deep into the mathematical derivations is not necessary to get good grades, but if you do decide to do that, the course (which is otherwise moderate) becomes very difficult. \n\n\n=========================Pros ============================\n\nYou get a good idea about how Bayes Theorem works in localization problems. In my opinion, the best part of the course was mini-projects and projects. I have found a new appreciation for the practical aspects of Robotics. Who knew noise control could be so tough!\n\nYou will learn a good deal about a variety of topics - from localization, to control, to search, and finally to SLAM. \n\nThis semester (Fall'18), the course was conducted very well. I think this was the first time a project on SLAM was introduced.  Sr. Lecturer Jay Summet was always present on Piazza to clear our doubts and help us in all possible ways. The TAs were responsive. Projects were timely graded and the overall experience was very positive.\n\n\n========================Cons===============================\n\nDo take the course if you want to know how self-driving cars are working. If you do not have much interest in the area, you might not enjoy the course much. The content lacks mathematical depth which I think is fair, but would be nice to touch upon. ",

It's a good course in basic canonical data analysis techniques with R. It uses the universally loved ISLR as a text, along with another text that's also nice to have on the shelf.\n\nThe weekly workload is very small, but don't let that fool you. This is where the course can be a little deceiving as, while the weekly lecture and readings won't take much time, you will be expected to REALLY know the material come test time.\n\nSpeaking of tests, there were two, a mid-term and a final. The tests are broken into 2 parts. Part 1 was multiple choice, about 50 questions (closed notes, closed books, no cheat sheet), and the class averaged about 78%. So not so easy. Second part of tests were coding in R and completely open everything, here the class average was low 80's. \n\nI did the opposite of the class in that I always did better on the multiple choice than average, but worse than average on the coding sections, which makes no sense until you realize that I have poor coding aptitude, I guess. \n\nDecent class, probably could have focused a bit more on business applications, given its name.

Actually, lets write four questions concerning that topic.\n\nI really have nothing good to say about this course. They set everyone up to fail with the lack of study guides, online support, and even basic English syntax on the exam questions.\n\nDon't even think about this class until they iron out the incredible kinks or find a professor who knows how to teach an online course.",

            "text": "I am writing this review as a sincere plea for Dr.Serban to consider changing the format of her class; and also some advice for future students. The short gist, is avoid this course if you can. If you must take it, I have a few thoughts ahead:\n\n*For students:*\nI've taken a few by consensus frustration-prone courses, Machine Learning and DVA. I always felt that a student should never complain about a class b/c the material was hard and/or you received a poor grade - if the class is pressing you, then you owe it to yourself and the professor to try to take on the challenge of the materials - that's when I've learned the most and come out better on the other end.\n\nHowever, this class is not one of them. Time Series Analysis is not so much a course on analyzing time series as much as it's learning how to taking the SATs aka training how to take a Prof. Serban's test. \n\nFor starters, the presentation of the class is the Professor throwing a bunch of math equations on the PowerPoint and then repeating every single Greek variable on the slide for the next 15 minutes... for the whole class. I've found it much better to listen to the lectures on mute and listening to your favorite YouTube concentration music... and deciphering the slides and math symbols on your own. Follow up with other students, StatsOverflow, other professor's lectures etc. \n\n*How To Master Prof.Serban's Exams*: You have to think like taking the SATs. Her exams are more learning how to triage quickly and eliminate possibilities like the SAT Read Comprehension parts and taking her practice exams and learning her question/language style than mastering the actual material. There's also sections on R Coding, the trick again is triaging by rubric (because people are rushed for time on her exams and some of the questions is more about debugging R than knowledge... and answering the parts with the most points first), and knowing how to copy-and-paste the right snippets of code from her past examples. \n\n*For the Professor:* \n\n*Logistics:* This semester we had so many issues with edX and students not being able to take the finals and mid-terms the day of because the link is missing, clock not working. It was ridiculous... please fix them for the well-being of future students. \n\n*Presentation:* I understand it's hard to make good teaching material and not everyone has the time. But some quick fixes would be to (a) make the lecture transcripts searchable, (b) make a condensed lecture notes of your equations since one page of notes worth much more than 2.5hrs of lectures of you repeating essentially the same thing, variable-by-variable.\n\n\n*Pedagogy:* I'd suggest you change the format of mid-term and final to be 24hrs so everyone is not rushed and think through all the problems. I'd suggest that you give students more sense of autonomy and ownership over the problem-sets by letting students pick their own data-sets to analyze (like Machine Learning). ",

It is not a graduate level database course,  it is an undergraduate level course and not a good one at that. The course highlights are EERD documents you'll never use in real life, studies in how outdated HDD drives work, and an emphasis on SQL rules not implemented in most real-life RDBMS systems. The first half of the course is entirely focused on theoretical database stuff that is far removed from the reality of databases in reality. Some people may be interested in the theory, but it is unlikely to be helpful in any way unless you develop relational databases. The 3rd quarter finally focuses on some SQL but only the very basics and provides very little practice. If you want to learn SQL, do a 3 hours lesson codecademy and you'll learn more. The last quarter of the class focuses on database file arrangement, HDD workings, and indexes. The last quarter is most definitely the most (possibly only) helpful section of the class. \n\nThere is a 3-phase group project that has some potential. The first 2/3 of the assignment are doing pointless diagrams and documents that you will almost entirely throw away when you reach phase 3 (just like you do with the first 1/2 of the class). The final 1/3 of the group project is to write an entire pinterest clone application. There is a ton of work that goes into this section and is the only part of the class where you will actually perform a legit SQL query in any meaningful way. Ultimately you will receive no feedback on your queries or your implemented database in any way whatsoever, and can only hope that you learned something.\n\nThe 4 tests are all terrible. The teachers believe the information they are teaching you is a gift from the gods and should be guarded and enshrined. Rather than focusing on students' learning of the material and the usefulness of the class material, they focus on how right the teachers are and how wrong the students are. The teachers will simultaneously claim they do not write \"trick\" questions while saying some of the questions are \"tricky.\" The truth is, they write questions that are pointlessly devious and mostly pull tiny detail facts that are either not true in reality or don't matter in any way.\n\nI think the class should be completely revamped and suggest no one take this class. If you took a database class at any point in your life, DEFINITELY do not take this class. The class is not hard per se, but the teachers make getting an A in the class an extreme uphill struggle no matter how many hours you choose to put into the class.",

It was nowhere near as difficult as people are making out to be due to the generous curve, which was a plus. However, I feel I learned very little for the amount of effort I put in. While the lectures had a friendly, fun vibe, I learned very little from them. There are much better resources available for free (for example, YouTube) that I had to use in order to gain an understanding of the material. I just think that since I'm paying to take this course, the lectures should be top-notch and not surpassed by free YouTube videos, which do a much better job at explaining the concepts.\n\nThe homework assignments did little to increase my understanding of the topics, and the comments from the TAs were not very helpful, for the most part.\n\nIn studying for the tests, I was having flashbacks to my undergrad days, wherein I'd cram in order to regurgitate the material on the test, only to forget it a few days later. Being that the OMSCS program is supposed to be the cutting edge in terms of educational content delivery, I think they could do a lot better. Why attempt to recreate the outdated and anachronistic in-person classroom experience when the medium allows for so much more (for example, making the course more interactive)?",

Most of content was really interesting, but the grading was pretty strict, the professor was nowhere to be seen, and the TAs weren't very helpful. There are 7 projects and 3 tests total in this class. The tests aren't bad as long as you study. Projects 2 and 3 were a bit tricky because they were easy to mess up on, but once you get past them the rest of the class is smooth sailing. As others have mentioned, halfway through the semester our head TA was randomly fired and the other TAs had to scramble to fill her spot. Honestly, I was a bit happy the head TA was gone because she was a bit mean and abrasive. For example, a lot of students had issues with the provided VM we were supposed to use for Project 1 (the file system kept randomly locking). Instead of being helpful and trying to resolve the issue, the head TA blamed us for the issue and refused to take us seriously when dozens of us posted on Piazza about our issues solely because they weren't able to replicate the issue on their machine. I had a friend (very competent person who would have done well in this course) drop solely because of the VM issues during the first project and how unhelpful the TAs were. The course became so ridiculous with the TA drama that the professor stepped in (who hadn't been seen in months) and showered us with extra credit assignments, which I didn't mind. Overall this was a class with interesting content, but I don't think I'd recommend it (especially not as a first course).",

            "text": "My feelings on this class were mixed. The workload was incredibly minimal: ~1 hour of video per week, plus one assignment per unit every 2-4 weeks (4 total), which generally took 1-4 hours. Videos for a given unit were released at the start of the unit, but typically I watched all the videos and completed the unit assignment over 1-2 days. Unfortunately, assignments were released the last Tuesday of the unit and due that Sunday night, which didn't allow you to read the homework over or work on the homework along with the videos if you followed the course schedule (where they're broken out by week). \n\nThere was a midterm and a final, both a 4-hour programming exam (open book/internet, very similar to homeworks) plus a 1-hour (closed-book) multiple choice exam. My main criticism was that the questions on the assignments/exams for the latter half of the course were often poorly worded or missing information. This made the last assignment and the final exam frustrating (there was a section of the programming final that had technical problems, causing a significant portion of the class to miss 15% of the questions (as of the time I'm writing this interview, we're still waiting to hear from the TAs whether they will be giving full credit for the questions). \n\nOverall, the course was almost no time commitment, but could benefit from some more quality control. I paired it with ML, which was a reasonable overall workload. The content is covered in a whole bunch of OMSA courses (such as DVA and Regression), so unfortunately I didn't really learn a whole lot, so I would recommend taking this as early as possible in the program if you want to have a better learning experience.",

I highly, highly recommend getting ahead on the video material because the assignments are so time consuming. Video lectures are fantastic and informative, and the supplementary material is interesting, but definitely not required to do decently in the course.\n\nAssignments are practically academic papers, and are usually ~10 pages in length. They are very time consuming - they require programming (although the prof actively encourages stealing code from the internet), creating analytic charts, and then interpreting your results and comparing and contrasting different algorithms.\n\nExams consist of 15-20 \"open response\" questions (a subset is T/F + justification). It tests your ability to synthesize information from the course, rather than your ability to program. You get 90 min for the midterm, 3 hours for the final (even though they're about the same number of questions). \n\nThe TAs had helpful office hours, especially when it comes to what they're expecting to see in the assignments. Getting answers in Piazza is a little bit of a crapshoot; there's so many students and posts. I have to say by far the most disappointing part of the class was that the professor spent a significant amount of time on Piazza, but 95% of his responses were sarcastic, making fun of the student, and decidedly unhelpful (a la \"you know the answer to that\", \"look at the syllabus\", etc.). The TAs actually bothered to answer questions, though they didn't get around to answering everything (unless it was submitted to the office hours question set). \n\nThere is a generous curve, most students end up with an A or B, despite exam averages around 55% (assignment averages were higher, but still not high).

            "text": "I came to this course with three years of Python programming having used the language for data science projects (using pandas, Numpy...). Consequently, 6040 was easy for me.\n\nHowever, based on the grade distribution and  students comments I've seen, there were two kinds of people taking the course: those who have a strong programming experience (or who are naturally gifted), and those with little to no experience. So, a lot of people from the latter group were complaining about the exams (that should be seen as \"big homework,” and not \"real exam\") being too difficult. I understand those complaints since there is a big discrepancy between the lectures' content and what is being asked during the exams.\n\nSo, here is my advice if you don't have a good programming background: go do courses on platforms such as DataQuest and DataCamp (I recommend DataQuest).  Make sure you cover topics such as pandas, Numpy and SQL. Then, when you take this course, you'll have a good time.\n\nI estimate that spending about 40 hours learning/practicing Python before this course would be enough. If you can, try to use Python at work (e.g., use pandas instead of Excel).",

Each week you cover one or two topics like machine learning algorithms, regression, missing data handling, and optimization. Then, you have to do a homework using R (Python sometimes). This is where you'll spend most of your time if you want to get 100% on each homework.\n\nBTW, the homework is peer graded. At first, i was a bit anxious about this process, but it turned out OK. I received only one grade that I felt was unfair, so i contacted the TAs about the situation and i got my homework regraded accordingly.\n\nThe exams were interesting, and you really need to have a strong understanding of the lectures' material. Make sure you revised math concepts before taking the exams (ANOVA, confidence intervals, what is a convex function...), as the teacher expects you to know them beforehand. Also, make sure you did the practice quiz before the first midterm, as it will help you understand how the ProctorTrack software works.\n\nTo sum up, take this course during your first semester. It will help you discover what subjects you will want to explore with the elective courses.",

The point is to make you aware of what all these tools are, and when you should consider using them. I appreciated that framework as I worked the group project, as I knew roughly what I needed to use and taught myself more depth as needed. \n\nI spent a lot more time than I wanted to on the group project, but it did force me to learn a lot and start grappling with open-ended and messy data science work outside the clean environment of toy problems typically encountered in an academic course. It's motivated me to carve out more time next semester to work Kaggle/open data problems because I learned so many things that I could not be taught in a lecture through diving into the project. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

For reference, I am a Network Engineer who deals with cybersecurity concepts on a regular basis, and have taken both Computer Networks and Intro to Information Security. I also have my undergrad from Tech (and a former TA) so I'm familiar with difficult courses.  I'm the target audience for the type of person who should enjoy this class.\n\nUnfortunately, this course is difficult due to absenteeism and apathy from both the professor and TA staff, and one particularly poorly designed project.\n\nI ended up dropping this class during Project 2. This project is infamous and was warned about from prior semesters. Instead of revamping the project or providing any context, the professor/TA doubled-down on it. The professor and TAs were virtually non-existent in both Slack and Piazza, and the best advice came from a former student of the class. After spending a week and a half and 60 hours on the project, primarily banging my head against Part 2 of the project and running out of time, I was forced to drop.\n\nWith any project there is a fine line between providing guidance and providing the answer. Graduate Intro to OS does a fine job of providing guidance even if it is frustrating at times. The only response I received from the TAs, after typing in detail the various things I had tried and the issues I was having, was a curt \"Look at the paper again\". \n\nConsidering this course is a requirement for the Online Cybersecurity program, I hope it is reviewed in a new light and significant changes are made, because as is it is a black mark on the fine Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\n",

These changes can range from trivial (adding a line of code) to non-trivial (implement an algorithm and necessary data structures within a predefined framework).\n\nAs a result, the course is heavily weighted towards breadth over depth. You probably get the most depth out of D3/javascript with almost an entire assignment dedicated to it, but for most other languages covered, you are barely scratching the surface, which is rather unfortunate.\n\nMost of the assignments are not conceptually all that difficult, but working through the environment setup and figuring out the logic of the frameworks can be quite tedious. The group project of course is not suited to the online experience. You have to hope you luck out with a decent group that will share the work. You'll basically want to get enough technical expertise within your group to cover the scope of building a data driven web app.\n\nThe teaching staff and TA's are responsive and engaged, which is great.\n\nUltimately, the course is alright, but I didn't really care for the survey nature of it, especially with so much time dedicated to environment setup. I think that it would benefit from focusing exclusively on SQL, Spark, and D3. ",

It was offered for the first time Fall 2018 for OMSA.\n\nFirst half of the class is mostly theoretical and the last half of the class is programming in WinBUGS/OpenBUGS.\n\nGrading Breakdown:\n1. 7 homework assignments and allow for 1 dropped HW (5% each for 30%)\n2. Class project (10%)\n3. Midterm (25%)\n4. Final Exam (35%)\n\nThe Midterm and Final Exam are both take home with 3 questions each. You have a week to complete each one, which is plenty of time. \n\nIt's not hard to get an A in this class, but I was a bit disappointed about some of the lecture videos. In the first half of the class, the lecture slides make  a lot of jumps for mathematical derivations and it can be confusing to follow. Relied on my peers on Slack, math stack exchange, and other online Bayesian readings to understand the material better. For the first part of the class I spent a good amount of time, maybe 14 hrs a week, trying to understand the math, but it dropped a lot more when it went into programming.\n\nThe homework assignments aren't due on a consistent basis. E.g. for some reason HW 5-7 were all due within 2 weeks in a 15 week semester. \n\nOpenBUGS (the program that we used) can be a little difficult to debug sometimes because there's not as much troubleshooting questions online and the documentation isn't that great compared to the Python & R we're used to. \n\nThe professor does provide a lot of OpenBUGS .ODC file examples which basically provide the exact template (after switching/adding a few variables) for later homework assignments and with the class project. \n\nThe class project is a solo project of your choosing. It's basically a homework assignment, but you have to find your own dataset and perform further analysis. It's not very long or difficult (5 page max) and I enjoyed doing it. Choosing a smaller dataset may be beneficial because OpenBUGS can run pretty slow based on your iterations, data, and variables. Class project is due same time as your final. Would suggest completing final first before starting your class project since it's worth more.\n\nIf you're on Mac, a student in my class (Thanks a lot Jared!!), posted instructions for using OpenBUGS in Virtual Box . His instructions are as follows:\n\n1.\tInstall VirtualBox\n2.\tGo to http://gatech.e-academy.com/ (will log you in with your GT credentials)\n3.\tGet your free student license key for Windows 10\n4.\tDownload Windows 10 ISO image from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/vlacademicwindows10iso\n5.\tOpen VirtualBox and create a Windows 10 VM (make sure 32/64-bit matches what you downloaded)\n6.\tThe first time the VM runs, point it to the windows ISO file\n7.\tWait for Windows to install (I set up on offline user account, using my GT Office365 account didn't work)\n8.\tEnable Copy/Paste by installing Guest Additions (https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#additions-windows) and then using the VirtualBox menus Devices > Shared Clipboard > Bidirectional. Might need a reboot. Note that you need to use the Ctrl key while in Windows to copy/paste.\n9.\tInside the Windows VM, download and install WinBugs or OpenBugs\n\nYou could also install OpenBUGS via Wine on Mac, but for some reason I couldn't get it to work so I used this for the entire semester.\n\nOverall, felt a little unsatisfied that the video lectures could have been better, but this is an interesting topic.",

The 14 homework assignments (1 every week) were pretty intense, but the good thing is you get to drop two. The 15th homework assignment is just a bonus and is not included in your grade.\n\nGrading Breakdown:\n1. Homework 25%\n2. Midterm 35% (90 minutes, 30 MC questions)\n3. Final 40% (180 minutes, 30 MC questions)\n\nYou're allowed one 2-sided notes for each test. Fall 2018 class average for the exams were (23.1/30) for midterm and (19.8/30) for final.\n\nThings I liked about this class:\n\n1. Uses Python (helps develop your Jupyter notebooks skills and also formulating equations in LaTex)\n2. Optimization is what ML algorithms are doing, so it's very relevant to everything we're learning.\n3. There was a decent amount of material that crossed over with concepts from other classes from a more \"optimization\" viewpoint\n\nBad things:\n\n1. Absolutely no professor interaction. The two TAs were great at responding to answers, but this is the first class I had where there wasn't a single professor Piazza interaction.\n2. No practice midterm/final\n3. Some of the test questions are just really difficult to get right without more practice from a practice midterm or final. Studying alone isn't sufficient enough to get the right answer. Tests were kind of demoralizing when I thought I did well, but after submitting I did way worse than expected. I think you have to have a truly good understanding of the concepts to apply them to the questions you see on the exam.\n4. Soo much material... it was hard to remember everything for the exams\n5. Errors on the midterm. There were several questions that had multiple checkboxes instead of radio buttons and credit wasn't given for questions if the wrong question was also selected. It didn't seem like the test was reviewed after it was published on Canvas. This probably shouldn't be a recurrent problem though.\n\nHave yet to see how generous the curve is.\n",

It provides a broad overview of the concepts and tries to get candidates to apply them. \n2. Easy workload - I listened to lectures on my way to work and averaged 1-1.5 hours on weekly assignments. Workload was manageable.\n3. Good exam philosophy - Exams were focused on testing the understanding of concepts. This was a truly great experience and I commend Joel for the hard work. I'd imagine setting 3 fair and substantial exams to be quite a challenging task.\n\nCons:\n1. Waste of time - I do a number of statistical modelling at work and felt that the materials were too shallow. Assignments were more annoying than constructive and I would have preferred to go into much more depth.\n2. Can't think of any complains\n3.

            "text": "This course is very true to what you read about it here. It has a lot of technologies introduced in every homework from Python, Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Deep Learning in PyTorch. Very few lectures but a lab portal for environment setup and labs, which was extremely helpful. Make sure you do the labs ahead of time if possible. There are 5 homeworks and a group project. \n\nYou cannot slack in this course on homeworks AT ALL. If you do not start homework the day you get it, you will not be able to finish on time. No Exam but after finishing homeworks, people had comments on piazza of \"Feeling like superman in the house\". Two late days are allowed for all homeworks combined. So, make sure to use them wisely towards the later homeworks as they are tougher.\n\nThe instructors/TAs are sometimes not present for days but in general helpful in what way they could be. People had a lot of complaints about that but all-in-all, if I look back, I enjoyed the course a lot. Deep learning homework was new and extra tough but I appreciate the learning and be able to do it first hand. At times, the course will be very overwhelming with work, life, family. But be ready to sacrifice a lot if you want to succeed in this course. \n\nThere's also a group project at the end. It has usual issues of group formation, participation, ownership etc. Personally I am not a fan of group projects and it stays so after this course too. ",

I have a full time job, family, etc. My background is NOT in development which is one of the reasons I chose this course as I wanted to get my feet wet with data and its manipulation. I found the course very difficult but really liked it. I'm expecting to safely pull away with an A.\n\nThe professor and TAs were great. They hold regular office hours. Grading is fair (but follow the rubric to the letter!)\n\nYou touch on so many really cool technologies, especially those that look good on a resume - Hadoop, Spark, Azure, AWS, PIG, Tableau, even a touch of machine learning at the end. But as others have mentioned you don't get to know any of them really well. Dr. Polo obviously knows what he's talking about and you can tell he's passionate about this stuff. Unfortunately, the lectures are really high level and are little help when you're actually doing the homework. They were helpful though for the bonus quizzes which seemed to come straight from the lectures.\n\nThere are no tests but the group project is a lot of work with a lot of deliverables. I was lucky and had a great group which helped a lot.\n\nIf I had it to do over again I would:\n\t<ul>\n<li>Prep for the class by becoming friends with D3, javascript and DOM concepts</li>\n<li>Start the assignments early!</li>\n<li>I personally would have a tutor on standby. Since my day job is not as a developer, there were times I really struggled with programming concepts that could likely easily be explained in a 30 minute sit down. Trying to have that \"sit down\" over Piazza posts or Slack office hours when you're not even sure what your question is is difficult.</li>\n<li>Be extremely detailed when reading the homework assignments. Unfortunately you don't get rubric in the form of a checklist. It's buried across the several paragraphs of the homework questions themselves.</li>\n<li>Piazza. I learned late in the game that Piazza cannot be treated as the place to go when *I* want to ask a question. It really needs to be treated like the class textbook where you go regularly to read. Just read. Because if you don't read through all the posts that you don't care about, you'll miss the 1 post where they mention you're not allowed to use that library in your homework that you just used last night. Or another where they mention an easy approach to the thing you've been struggling with for 10 hours.</li>\n</ul>",

The lectures are pretty theoretical, but I believe they give a strong foundation if you really dedicate your time there. Be prepared to learn a lot by yourself and use other sources like the videos from Berkeley, DeepMind and David Silver on RL.\n\nI have a ML/DL background from Udacity - Deep Learning, so I decided to take this as my first course and I don't regret it. If you don't have a ML background I suggest taking this course first.\n\nThere are 6 Homeworks and 3 projects. Project 1 and 3 are replication of papers and project 2 is the Lunar Lander from OpenAI Gym.\n\nDue to my time zone, I always watched the recorded OH sessions in Blue Jeans, which helped a lot. This is where the TAs give advice on how to to complete the HW or the Projects.\n\nTAs showed a lot of knowledge and where very active on Piazza. They would also show up on slack channel to help but perhaps also to monitor discussions.\n\nI have a busy work, a wife and a kid which posed a challenge to attend this course due to the time required to watch lectures and read the papers, but it is absolutely doable if you have discipline and start the assignments as soon as they are released.\n\nInterest in Reinforcement Learning has increased a lot in the last 3 years after the paper from DeepMind about a RL agent playing Atari Games and the launch of AlphaGo. Other players such as OpenAI, Unity are investing heavily on it.\n\nEveryone interested in ML/AI should definitely take this course!",

Miguel Morales, the head TA **should be** the head instructor for this class and he should have the power to modify the course, he's writing a book on RL, so he's pretty qualified.\n\nRegarding the workload it varies, I was very busy this semester and was still able to deliver all homeworks with some help from GitHub. The projects require replicating paper results, which is an absolute hell given that authors give very lackluster descriptions and not enough information to replicate their experiments, but even if you aren't able to replicate them 100% you can still get a decent grade, TAs are very fair as long as you show effort. The last project requires linear programming with CVXOPT, the second project requires knowledge of POMDPs, linear function approximation or Deep RL, the first project is just an implementation of TD(lambda).\n\nThe only exam was the final exam, which I expected to be like the one in ML (i.e Isbell's questions, which can be very hard for normal people, but in this case the exam was easier.  As long as you review the material completely and understand the basic concepts you should make it. I hadn't watched more than 60% of the lectures for the semester and I reviewed them in the last week and still I think I did good.\n\nYou could dismiss most lectures and still have good grades on homeworks and projects, as long as you're fairly able to use Google effectively.\n\nIf you're expecting some interaction with Littman of Isbell, it is NONEXISTENT, NULL, ZERO.

            "text": "### Overall, a great course! Glad they changed to the \"new\" format...\n\nMy first course in OMSCS.\n\nThis course was challenging in that it required learning a plethora of new languages, frameworks, and tools in a short amount of time. Some students may see this as negative; I chose to see this as positive, equipping me for the \"real world\" where I will get thrust into situations where I don't have a TA to hand me an answer...\n\nThis course was also challenging because of the group project. We started with 5 members; 3 dropped the class and we completed the project with 2! But we survived. Towrads the end of semester, it seems the TA's got lazy and gave almost everyone 100% on the final report (worth 25% of the grade!!!), as the **mean** score was 97.7%....choose your group members wisely and do not select an English undergrad to be in your group (lesson learned...)\n\nI was frustrated a bit with the amount of hand-holding in this class...students complaining about how \"hard\" it is to learn all these new languages. Well...this is a *Master's* program!! The reason this frustrates me is that it totally devalues my Master's degree if anyone can come in, have their hand held through the entire degree, and be awarded at the end. Ok, rant over.\n\nMost of the HW was easy, just time consuming with a lot to do, lots of i's to dot and t's to cross...HW's are moving targets with requirements changing daily based on student questions or debates over ambiguity. Nevertheless, there is a LOT of boilerplate, template code where all you have to do is \"fill in the blanks\"...ah memories of undergrad freshman programming classes... ;)\n\nToggl Time Report: https://goo.gl/L3DC9Y\n\nEach HW is granted **3 weeks** to complete... plenty of time if you START RIGHT AWAY. Seriously. Start right away. Just not the day it is released.. start a couple days after it's released so that rather than wasting your time with kinks that weren't figured out, you can come to Piazza and observe all your most pressings questions asked and hopefully answered.\n\n#### Time consumer and topics covered/tools & languages used:\nHW1: https://goo.gl/vCHHCG\n29 hours\n* Python/APIs\n* Gephi/graph viz\n* SQLite\n* Javascript & D3 Intro\n* OpenRefine\n\nHW2: https://goo.gl/7oNpHs\n35 hours (longest). If you don't know Javascript before coming into this class, you're gonna have a HARD time on this HW. I am quite familiar w/ Javascript (I would rate myself 4/5 on expertise) and you can see how long it took me.\n* Tableau\n* D3, D3, and more D3! (loved learning D3...very powerful and useful library)\n\nHW3: https://goo.gl/uaAxb3\n24 hours (shortest). The TA's did an excellent job providing lots of guides on how to get up and running with AWS, Azure, etc. All I can say is USE A MAC! It will make your life MUCH EASIER!!! ssh...scp...etc. Also, spend time and dig in...LEARN how to use these tools, don't just complain it is being dumped on you\n* Intro to Hadoop (very simple algorithm). 1 Question run on a pre-config'd VM, 1 Question run on Azure\n* Intro to Spark (again, very elementary algorithm). Run on Cloudbricks cloud-based env...almost 0 setup\n* Intro to Pig... very easy to pick up..Google and the class slides are your friend.\n* Azure ML studio...almost not worth mentioning. Beyond easy. Follow a tutorial...\n\nHW4: https://goo.gl/hjVwdu\n25.5 hours (one of the most challenging). I had 0 ML experience coming into this class, which would explain why this HW was the most difficult for me. If you're familiar w/ SKLearn & numpy it will be easier. Still...questions were quite lenient in retrospect, lots of pre-baked template code where you fill in the blanks.\n* warmup exercise w/ mmap (fill in the blanks to pack/unpack binary files)\n* build a Decision Tree Random Forest in Python from scratch (this was the challenging part, without any guidance or algorithm...all I can say is Google ;) )\n* SKLearn to test different ML algs and report accuracies\n\nNo exams, thank goodness!",

The tests require some cleverness, and even though the answers are usually pretty straightforward, you can trick yourself into overthinking it.  Once you start thinking the wrong way about a problem it's hard to get out of that way of thinking without getting up to take a walk, which you obviously can't do during a test.  Seeing the timer tick down, and having the responsibility to stop in time so you can scan your answers does not help. </li>  <li> Directions on the homework and tests were at times insufficient, and they will penalize you for not following directions that were not explicitly stated.</li><li>There is no curve (at least that I know of)</li><li>Before the final (which is cumulative), they give you 3 weeks of studying without much of a peep or any work, so it can be stressful trying to manage your time effectively.</li><li> It's hard to escape the feeling of dark cloud of impending doom looming over you the entire semester. </li><li>I was borderline between an A and a B pretty much the entire semester, but after some mistakes on the final, I will not get an A in the class.

Professor Flury was very accessible and I thought all the assignments/exams were fair. A couple tips:\n\n1. Don't buy the course packs, all the exam questions are covered in lecture or the weekly videoconferences.\n2. The videoconferences dragged well past an hour quite often. I recommend skipping them and instead downloading to listen at 1.5x+ speed later.\n3. There was only one homework after the midterm so it's super easy to stop watching lectures for awhile but then it becomes a real slog to get through them before the final. Try to keep up with the pace the professor recommends or at least not get too far behind it. \n4. Make flashcards using a system like Anki as you watch lectures so you can do a few a day and cut down on cramming before exams.",

Practical knowledge will almost entirely come from your project teammates who have work experience.\n\nThe most important part of this class happens in the first week: team formation. Make sure you have a group that aligns on a common stack and includes members with both front end and back end experience. The teaching staff don't give many details in that regard until late in the course, so be proactive in communicating with your classmates or you'll be hurting in the last five weeks when you actually build the application. The only thing related to the actual implementation that gets taught in this course is the SQL (at a basic level), so make sure your team collectively has full-stack expertise already.\n\nOn the plus side, the lectures are decently organized and mildly entertaining. On the down side, the exams are way harder than what's presented in the lectures and lean heavily theoretical. The exams are pretty standard academia, challenging in ways that aren't going to directly benefit you. The professor says there are no tricky questions, just precise ones. Whether you consider this to be academically rigorous or pedantic is up to you. If you're new to databases and want to become a DBA or really master the subject this might be a good course for you, but anyone interested in just using databases effectively may find the theory to be more trouble than it's worth. There's no advanced practical topics like locking, NoSQL, or anything of that nature.\n",

Kudos to Prof. Flury and the TAs!\n\n**(2) On content** -- I learned a lot of new stuff from all of the professors. I liked how they showed expertise in their own fields and answered questions from students well.\n\n# Weaknesses\n**(1) On content relevance** -- As part of the OMSA core curriculum, there's a lot the course can improve on to be more relevant to Analytics students. There has been some attempts (e.g., via the \"Digital Marketing podcast\" under Marketing module) but the integration could be more explicit across the different modules.\n\n**(2) On content delivery** -- OK in general (via video lessons and video conferences), but I found module 5 (Marketing) in particular to be very jargon-heavy and sometimes redundant. Similarly, most of the self-assessment questions and final exam questions on Marketing favor a rote memorization type of learning, which isn't helpful since we'll forget them in the long-run anyway.",

The content was interesting and Professor Sokol does a very nice job with the videos. Piazza and Slack communities are active and helpful. Would definitely recommend this as a first-semester course in the OMSA program.\n\n#### Prepping for the course\n* Learn R (you don't have to be a master, but proficiency would be very helpful).\n* Learn either R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks\n\n#### Exams\n* There are two Mid Term exams and a Final, which is cumulative.\n* Each exam counts for 25% of your grade\n\n#### The Good\n* Course videos are very well done\n* You get a high-level overview of several different analytical methods\n* The homeworks give you a better idea of how the concepts are applied in a practical sense\n* The last few homeworks and course project are more of a case-study, which lets you think critically about a multi-part problem.\n* Exams aren't super time-consuming. Mid Terms were 1-1.5 hours and the final was 2-2.5 hours.\n\n#### The Bad\n* The exam questions can have tricky-wordings. You need to read the questions carefully (and then re-read them)!\n* Peer grading on the homeworks and course project can be hit-or-miss. Luckily the TAs are available for regrades if you think you've been wronged.\n* ProctorTrack\n* There are a couple times in the semester where you have a lot going on between working on your homework, studying for a midterm, and doing peer reviews. Manage your time wisely. You can't really work-ahead too much in this course.\n\n#### The Ugly\n* There are 14 total Homeworks (lowest 2 get dropped). While these homeworks are helpful in learning the material, they can take a lot of time; particularly if you are striving for 100% (instead of just 90%). Despite the big time-commitment, the homeworks collectively count for only 16% of your grade, which means each one is just over 1% of your total grade.\n",

For the RL part tho, Littman was excellent. It's hard to find decent lectures on RL (apart from the ones by Silver) and the ones by Littman are probably the best for intro to RL.\n\nThe projects are where the majority of the learning happens. You are given a purposefully vague description of what you are supposed to do and write for the report - yes, you can rip code off the internet as all of the grading is done based on your report. These are also useful as part of a portfolio you are building if you want to be in a ML field eventually. The projects are not too hard to do. Once  you setup a pipeline for experiences you can pretty much use the same pipeline for the almost all of the projects. \n\nThere are 2 exams - the Midterm is the difficult of the 2. IMHO the tests did nothing to reinforce/test the knowledge I gained from doing the course. I liked RL's final exam a bit better.\n\nThis course is going to take alot of time if you are not used to quickly doing a lot of experiments and are new to the ML subject. But you do have 1 month for each of the 4 projects and if you plan properly, you can do well without any of the last minute panicking which most students do.\n\nOverall, it's a decent course - I expected a bit more depth and bit more time spent on each algo - trying out how it works, internally and getting to know the basics inside out. Nevertheless, this course is a good intro to ML - don't expect to learn a lot/new stuff if you have already taken MOOCs and/or have prior experience in this field.",

I would guess if you took some other AI or ML courses in the program before this one (maybe ML4T?), it would help you get through the assignments more quickly.\n\nI probably spent 30 hrs/wk most most weeks, around 40 hrs for the week of the midterm, and honestly probably 50 hrs on the final.  I actually decided to take 2 days off from work (Thurs and Fri) the week of the final just to make sure I had enough time to work on it, and I'm really glad I did.\n\nThe weeklong open book/open notes nature of the exams means that they *really* make you dig deep and earn every point.  I actually found that I learned the most during the exams themselves because I'd look everything up in the textbook or lecture notes.\n\nAll in all, it's a very good course. Professor Starner and the TA's are great.  Just make sure you're able to dedicate a lot of time to it.",

You can get a lot of help from your fellow classmates.\n* Know C. Make sure you understand the concept of pointers (including pointers to pointers and pointers to functions) and working with strings. You can learn as you go but it's helpful to know something ahead of time.\n* Start projects early. I can't stress this enough. You have 4 weeks for pr1 (probably less in Summer) which seems like a lot but there are 4 different parts, each with a client and a server. Project 3 is also a huge undertaking.\n\nFor the most part I really enjoyed the projects. There are some repetitive components (by project 4 I was a little tired of multi-threading things with pthreads) but each project had us working with different components. Project 3 has a significant design component and you aren't given much direction regarding how to implement your solution. I had many moments of frustration but the end product is something I was extremely proud of.\n\nThe exams are challenging,  ensuring that you understand the material and didn't just memorize facts.

But it is extremely hard, and that is mostly because of my lack of python, numpy, or OpenCV experience before this class. If you’re in the same boat, think hard about this decision before you do it because you will be overwhelmed and challenged. In the end, it worked out for me and I hope that it does for you as well. One thing I like to provide in reviews are the project difficulties and some tips.\n\n1.\tEvery two weeks you get a project. Do not waste time in the beginning and do not misjudge PS1 – it is easy and that is the only easy project you get this semester. In order of difficulty, I would say PS2, 5, and 7 (final project) are the hardest, requiring over 30 hours of work to complete.  \n2.\tPS2 is a monster of a project. It took me greater than 50 hours of time to complete. Get started on it as soon as possible. I think they did this to weed out people from the class. For example, my class lost a hundred students to that project. It wasn't as bad as other semesters because we got an extra day to submit due to Bonnie troubles. I spent several long nights getting it to work and somehow got a 98 on it.\n3.\tThe TA’s are pedantic. You need to strictly follow their rules regarding the report. You put an image outside of the box, or too big for the box, you get points off. Also, make sure to answer every facet of the question they provide to you. They are sticklers for the details.\n4.\tThe final is open book, but don’t let this fool you. The breadth of content is staggering. Do yourself a favor and go through the lectures the week they are required. What I normally did was skimmed through non-project lectures, and took time in the project related lectures. \n5.\tTo anyone who says the study guide isn’t a solid representation of the test is dead wrong and probably did not use it. Create your own study guide and fill in all the answers, using the shared key as a last ditch. I assure you, simply doing this will get you at least half of the questions on the exam directly. \n6.\tUse slack. This is a no-brainer. The TA’s are specifically instructed not to help you in most situations. Using the slack channel, I made exactly 0 requests on Piazza and ended with a 99 in the class. \n\nBest of luck to you and I hope you enjoy CV!\n\n",

However, do not mistake this class for a give-me, it had some very difficult portions and was closer to Computer Engineering than Computer Science for some sections.\n\nAssignments:  \n- 4 Homeworks, all were straightforward as long as you ask some questions and review the material.\n- 2 Projects.  First one is a group project, second was individual.\n- 1 Test, the final.  Not easy, but fair and tested very similar concepts from the graded assignments and lesson material.\n\n\nCoding was only required for 2 of the assignments:  \n- HW2 involved coding, in C++ . \n- Project 1: was very difficult for me, it involved coding with graph algorithms and C++ to build an instruction scheduler.\n- Project 2: coding was not needed, but a few bash scripts and/or python dramatically sped up how fast you completed it. \n\nLectures & Course Material (Books):\n- In my opinion, ok.  The book is a little old, but the foundational concepts it teaches are certainly still applicable.\n- The lectures had small errata/errors hear and there, but TAs were responsive in addressing them.\n\nThe advice I would give is go to the office hours! Professor Pande showed up to every single one, along with the TAs, and all were more than willing to answer questions or address concerns to point you in the right direction.  Also, and this is probably every OMSCS class, but start the assignments as soon as possible, especially project 1!!  It is very do-able, but the 2 week delay my team took to get started turned it into a semi-hell for the last 3 weeks of it.",

I guess there's really no time for a professor to dole out actual detailed advice on a MOOC - once you start, you would never be able to stop.\nIt would be good if you could receive more timely, detailed, and consistent feedback on assignments, but I think delivering on all three fronts simultaneously would add to the list of impossibility theorems - there's no free lunch, as professor likes to say. \nHomework and exams are well designed to make you think about and apply what you have learned; good grades are hard earned. But ... lack of transparency in the grading process leaves many wondering how to improve.\n\nHard to say how many hours I averaged, the two weeks leading up to assignment due dates were possibly 50-60 hour weeks, and the couple of weeks I took as relative down time only made the following weeks worse.\n\nDespite any flaws this is engaging and a must-take course if you're at all interested in the data science / computational analytics, both for the criticality of the material and the quality of the learning.\n\nDon't spend so much time tinkering with data that you don't leave enough time to write a good report.",

            "text": "Overall, I enjoyed this course.  This really feels like a combination MBA/CS course, so if you are looking for pure CS, this may not be for you.  I have not taken any of the other ML courses yet, which did not seriously impact my ability to get things done, so for most people the same thing should apply.  This course definitely got my excitement up for taking more ML courses!\n\nAs for the projects - if you are not a strong programmer they can be extremely challenging.  Do not come into this course expecting the opportunity to skill up from zero experience and be ready for later projects - you need a bit of familiarity with Python to get started, but the basic usage of NumPy and Pandas are covered in the lectures, but you're somewhat on your own figuring out how to make them work efficiently.  Make sure you use an IDE (such as PyCharm) that can help you effectively write and debug code.  In the Fall 2018 semester we were still using Python 2.7, and you must use specific packages for auto grading compatibility, but I believe Dr. Balch has stated they are working on getting to Python 3 and newer package versions soon.  Almost all code is auto graded, with the majority of test cases provided to you, with a few hidden cases (hidden in that you haven't been given the auto grading case, but the assignment directions will definitely point to edge cases you may need to consider). In addition, some of the projects have both code and reports that must be written, so if writing is not your thing, be aware.\n\nThe organization of this course was somewhat underdone, in that the course schedule wasn't finalized until about two weeks in, and most assignments were not finalized until about a week before their due date.  There were usually only minor changes, if any, from what the assignment page on the course wiki originally had, although the final project had some moderate changes.  This was the first time the course was on Canvas, so it may take a few semesters before things are running smoothly on Canvas.  The lectures on Udacity are usually watched out of order, and there are additional lectures/recorded office hours on YouTube that are required, so not everything is in one place.  In addition, you get to watch a movie for this class, \"The Big Short\", but have to procure it on your own - which is not a big deal, you can buy/rent it for streaming or a Blu-ray for less than most textbooks - but some were put off by the fact that they had to do this.\n\nThe exams were entirely hosted on ProctorTrack (as in, none of the exam content was delivered using Canvas).  That's a little annoying because I think Canvas provides a better test-taking experience for students.  The exams themselves were multiple choice, with about a minute per question budget (30 questions ≈ 35 minutes).  The content of the exams wasn't too difficult, and the second exam and crowdsourced from the students, which meant if you could memorize the questions, you could do very well on that exam. \n\nFinally, Piazza - this class had several sections combined into one Piazza section, and it was definitely messy.  There were nearly 2500 posts over the semester, and many of them were duplicate questions or questions that were being covered on a pinned post.  The course team did a pretty good job managing, and were very active in berating people who didn't look things up first.  Some might find that harsh but I think it's almost required in order to get people to change their behavior.\n\nOverall - the pace of this course was a bit rapid, but it covered a lot and accomplished a lot.  It may not have gone as deep for some, but again this is more of a survey and practical applications kind of course.  It's definitely a good appetizer if you are just getting started with machine learning.",

Interesting concepts for the most part, but overlapping assignment due dates, snail's pace feedback, scatterbrained lectures, and a single exam as a comprehensive final at the end of the course with no types of tests/quizzes before then made for a very poor experience.\n\nProject 1 is quite involved (creating a scheduler for a compiler) and working in teams of 3 is not great when people are still dropping the course. This project is hard enough that if one of your team members drops out or goes AWOL, you are in for some extreme pain. Make sure you have a strong background in C/C++. I had a little bit of experience but still needed to learn a good bit for this project. At a minimum you'll want to at least understand pointers and basic function writing in C++. Also, the instructions really gloss over a number of mundane details which means the project is going to take a lot longer than you might first expect.\n\nThe 4 homeworks were fair, but it took forever to get grades back. It wasn't until the final week we got back assignments 3 and 4. That gives you just enough time to study for the final, which they say covers everything, which is great since there are no other exams in the course to give you an ide of how to study. Also regarding feedback, neither project 1 or 2 was returned to us, so going into the final 60% of the course grade was unknown or undetermined. \n\nAs far as the conceptual content, the material is somewhat interesting but the second half of the course is a bit messy and lost in tangents because it basically covers all the professor's research. You get a bunch of 40 page journal papers to read in addition to watching the lectures. The lectures themselves have a bunch of spots where things aren't adequately explained and sometimes it feels like the professor recorded the narration while he was driving for all the thought he put into the clarity of his words.\n\nOverall, this course seemed promising but ended up being quite a disappointment.",

The 2nd mid-term exam was surprisingly harder.

The homework assignments were beautifully designed, and helped a student learn by doing it. The lecture videos were concise and focused, and the professor was super articulate. I did almost zilch participation in the forum discussions, online office hours, or the practice exams. So much time was spent on studying and catching up on every aspect of the class.

The workload ramps up considerably in the last 4-6 weeks.\n\nIt's a survey course, so it covers the seminal systems research papers over the last 4 decades to the modern age. There is a lot of information here. If you read and understand every paper, as Professor Kishore recommends, this course easily hits 20+ hours/week. I started to suffer from information overload, and skipped the last 20 papers.\n\nFortunately, reading the papers isn't necessary to get a good grade. Watching the lectures and reading the prior exams is enough to do well in the midterm and finals.  I still highly recommend reading the more interesting papers though, if you can. You will learn a lot.\n\nThe projects are tough, but really good. I found them far more relevant than IOS (you use grpc for instance, not ancient rpcgen). Writing barrier algorithms was probably my favorite. On the downside, the projects are far less structured than IOS. The requirements can be a little vague, and there is no Bonnie for testing your project. You have to figure out the tests yourself, and be confident in your solution before submitting it.\n\nThere is no hand holding in this course!

            "text": "I loved this class. Professor Ada went above and beyond to be involved with the class. She was very responsive via email (I literally got a response back within hours) and did weekly office hours.\n\nThe TAs for this class were extremely standout. They're always hanging out in the 6200 Slack (one of the TAs actually paid out of pocket to host a private Slack instance so that there's search history available for everyone, which is extremely useful for the projects). They're always around to offer hints and help with the projects.\n\nThe lectures themselves were long, but really great and informative. The readings for this class were also extensive, so prepare yourself. However, watch the lectures first and then do the reading. Professor Ada does a great job in making the papers a lot easier to understand.\n\nThis class is no walk in the park, but it's also not hard as long as you try to stay consistently on top of the lectures. All of the projects are released about a month ahead of time, so get started the first moment they open. I also know the first instinct for a lot of people when met with coding problems is to charge ahead and start coding. I highly advise you to not do that. First, read through the README. And then maybe do it again. It might leave you confused, but they're extremely thoroughly worded to help guide your architecture of your programs. Then, read through all of the code. (Everything is in C, so start brushing up on C, particularly with string manipulation and pointers.) I found it extremely helpful to read through everything and then leave comments with TODOs to mark up the entrypoints of where I needed to code.\n\nThe midterm and final were also pretty challenging. The course covers a LOT of content, so study up on the study guide and the sample tests that are provided. Make sure you are VERY solid on the math portions towards the end of the semester, since they are likely to be heavily tested.\n\nThis was my first course in OMSCS and I'm really looking forward to the rest of the courses if they're all as fun and engaging as this one. I don't have an undergrad CS, nor did I have prior experience with C (though I code everyday in Golang and dabble in Rust, which helped a lot), so don't be afraid to come into this course even if you have experience with neither. You can definitely pick C up along the way if you start your projects early and do a lot of Stack Overflow/Googling.",

Dr Joyner, the main instructor is a great teacher, he's really kind, super geeky in a good way, and passionate about his field of study. The lectures are well made.\n\nMy biggest problem with this class is the content is basically a week or two's worth of information spread out over an entire semester. The people who will enjoy this class enjoy writing papers, enjoy conducting surveys and analyzing qualitative data, and are not particularly passionate about writing code.",

            "text": "This is a well organized and well run course. There is no coding involved, so it is a nice course to take after something like AI or ML if you need a break from the intense programming assignments. You are allowed to form your own group for the final project. Grading was fair and good feedback was given. Tests are open book/open note, challenging but doable if you keep up on the readings and lecture videos. \n\nThis class felt like a bit too much work. Not necessarily busy work, there was value in each task, but there are a lot of moving parts. There is an 8 page assignment due each week for the first 12 weeks, which gets a bit overwhelming. There are 3-5 readings each week (required for the tests), and they can be 30+ pages each. On top of that you are peer reviewing other classmates' work and planning ahead for a personal project and group project. I would have liked to see the work consolidated a bit so that more focus could be given to each task.\n\nDefinitely a front-loaded course, the last few weeks were much easier (however I did have an amazing group for the group project, so that helps). I'd say it's a good first course for OMSCS, but please don't think this is representative of other courses in the program. I'm not sure I would recommend pairing it with another class, with the weekly assignments there isn't much time in between for other work. Having said that, assignments are all released on day 1 so you can work ahead, with good time management two courses would be possible. ",

            "text": "I was a big fan of this class. It wasn't perfect, but the material covered was broad and interesting. I didn't find it to be quite as difficult as the reviews indicate here, but it does require solid Python and Numpy skills. As such, I'd recommend taking some other courses first (KBAI, AI4R, CV are all great pre-reqs for this class). The projects were somewhat time-consuming but certainly doable in the allotted two weeks. The exams were harder - and much longer - than the projects, but I felt we were given ample time to complete them (open-note, take-home tests). Although, I could see the time commitment being difficult with a busy work schedule or another course being worked in parallel.\n\nMy only complaint with the class was that the Bonnie test results for some of the projects did not provide helpful feedback after submitting assignments. Even after passing all of the local unit tests for a given assignment, there were times at which Bonnie tests would fail, and no information was returned about the reason for the failures. This led to some brute-force/blind debugging in some cases, which was a little frustrating. \n\nOverall, it's a good course if you have any interest in AI. Like many other courses, it covers a multitude of topics at a shallower depth, rather than covering fewer topics at a more advanced level. I would not pair this class with another unless you have plenty of time to spare. And I would not take this as a first course unless you are prepared for the workload required. ",

The grading was lenient, and support on piazza was timely and helpful. \n\nThe benefit of this class lies in the assignments, which generally deal with fully implementing something simple, and the lessons learned are applicable. You won't find this breadth of practical challenges in most courses, and it is important if you ever want to leave simulation.  This I considered to be the main benefit of the course.\n\nI have worked on several cyber-physical systems in the past and have an engineering background, so I have a good grasp of what's involved in both structure of the problems as well as the underlying math. However, I did notice some other students struggled with some of these aspects, that are tangential to the course. Unfortunately, the class lectures attempt to address the structure aspect, and leave out a lot of practical knowledge needed to complete the course. I would say that if you have designed (not just copied) a robot or anything similar in the past, you won't have an issue.  \n\nI will say that if the two course sections were independent, it would be an improvement, as well as if there were some other courses to follow and could spread out some of the content.",

It is heavier on the analysis than the testing. You don't cover unit testing or anything basic. The lectures rely a good bit on formal logic and outlining theory, but the labs have a direct implementation of each.

            "text": "#### Pros\nThe video lectures are great, the textbook is good, some interesting algorithms are covered, and the TAs get test grades back very quickly.  At the end there was a 5% curve up to A and a 10% curve up to B if you need that sort of help.  I had an A before the curve, but it was nice to see the instructors be generous at the end of a hard semester (where many people reported they were just below the original B cutoff).\n\n#### Cons\nThis class is taught under a cloud of fear (since most students can't graduate without it), so it's hard to enjoy.  It's a theory course more applicable for students targeting a career in academia than the professional world.  It's the least practical course I've taken in OMSCS.  It's probably good for \"interview questions\", but that hasn't been a significant portion of my (long) career.\n\nThe exams are too heavily weighted (85%) relative to homework (5%).  We had 15 problems total on 3 tests, so each test problem was worth 85/15th = 5.66% of our overall grade.  So a single test problem (taken under closed book conditions) was worth more than the entire semester's worth of homework (which took dozens of hours).\n\nThe course schedule was too front loaded.  There was no homework the last 4 weeks, and no lessons the last 3 weeks.  This semester was paced almost like a summer class, which makes me wonder why GA isn't offered in the summer.\n\nThe instructors seemed very reluctant to ever endorse student answers on Piazza.  According to the Piazza report, of the 313 student answers, only 41 (13%) were instructor endorsed.  The other 87% of student answers were not all wrong; most were just ignored by the TAs.\n\nOther thoughts:\n* There were way too many threats about regrade request penalties after tests.\n* Dynamic programming is way over-emphasized in this course relative to its real-world applicability.\n* Having to scan hand-written documents and upload them during exams is kind of nerve-racking (but better than typing LaTeX).\n* This was Dr. Brito's first semester, and he's the fourth algorithms instructor in 5 years (after Charlie Brubaker, Chris Pryby, and Eric Vigoda).  So there's not much stability in this course.\n\nFor those that want to take GA before your last class, [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/9nz1zj/is_it_true_that_i_will_have_a_0_chance_of_getting/e7qbwx5) sums up my opinion: Let OMSCS take you out to dinner first before it f**ks you.\n",

            "text": "Fantastic course. I took the course without much preparation and even though I did well in my mid-term and final (above median), I struggled with Numpy which costed me dearly in two of the assignments. This was my first course in AI and ML and did not know what to expect. As others mentioned the pace of the course is very fast and it covers alot of material (To excel at AI, one requires at least two or three semester to learn the topics that are covered in the text book and the lectures.). Prof Starner and the TAs are outstanding. If you are looking for an A, assuming you have not had any AI courses in the past and/or relevant experience, you should get higher than median for 5 out of 6 assignments and both exams (Not easy). median for the assignments is in the 90s so you should go for extra credit and bonus opportunities if you can. Definitely attend the TA office hours as needed. They are very knowledgeable and will help you immensely (I should have done more in this area).   You need good planning skills to go through this fast paced course. No room to relax. If you miss a week, forget A, if you miss three weeks, consider dropping the course. The assignments are challenging and there are a number of extra credit opportunities that allow you to improve your grade. However, I feel that for most parts the students who have had prior AI/ML training will be better equipped to do the bonus and extra credit parts and raise the assignment median. In effect making it harder for those who are new to AI to  compete and receive a higher grade. I liked the take home tests because due to the nature of this course and difficulty of the topic, it is impossible to do it any other way. You should view all the lectures and read all the relevant chapters in the text book to do well. It is hard to get partial credit as the final answer is what counts.",

            "text": "This course is the real deal for learning AI. You're reading the quintessential AI textbook \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\" nearly cover to cover, co-authored by the former Google search algorithm director Peter Norvig, who is also a guest lecturer in the Udacity videos. Another guest lecturer is Sabastian Thrun, the creator of Udacity and founder of Google X and their self-driving car team. The professor himself, Dr. Starner, is an entrance examiner for the AI PhD progam and draws from industry experience at Google when structuring the assignments.\n\nPerhaps this is intended to justify the often overwhelming course workload, which is comprised of the work of two courses in a sense. At the time of this writing (Fall 2018), one of those courses would involve completing the six assignments that are each 2-3 weeks long, of which only five count towards your grade. The other course would involve keeping up with the extensive learning material, such as lecture videos, textbook readings, and supplemental journal articles in order to prepare for a midterm and comprehensive final exam (taking me 17 and 24 hours to complete, respectively) that are structured like puzzles and brain teasers loosely based on concepts from the material. My weekly effort spent on this course ranged from 20-60+ hours. There was always something that I should be working on throughout the semester and that was exhausting at times, to the point that I regrettably skipped the final assignment to catch up on learning materials to prepare for the final.\n\nFor those of you who are limited on time to devote to the class as I was, my recommendation is to watch all of the lecture videos prior to the start of the semester, and then read and appropriately skim the textbook based on the provided list of topics for the midterm and final, which would provide a much more manageable workload. Also be sure to start the assignments as soon as possible. I'm definitely not knocking the challenging aspect of the assignments or of the unique format for the exams, both of which contributed greatly to my learning experience, but I would have preferred a more narrow approach to the ambitious syllabi than is currently offered. This will be my first B in a technical college-level course, but don’t let that intimidate you - learn from my mistakes!\n\nA note about time management: I consider myself to be someone with a lot of time management experience who always keeps a lot on his plate. Having said that, this course nearly broke me. With a full-time job, married life, and the everyday stresses of maintaining health and sanity, this one course made me lose more hours of sleep than I was comfortable with and it was my only course this semester. If you plan to take this course, bare in mind that it will require you to keep a rigorous schedule for studying, which must also be flexible enough to postpone other priorities to allow for more study time.",

This is very much an engineering course so make sure to brush up on your probability, linear algebra, trigonometry and python. The course is all projects  so depending on how diligent you are you may find yourself doing next to nothing some weeks and working 30 hours another week to finish a project. I recommend this course for a first semester student. I do wish we went a little more in depth into the details and proofs of some of the algorithms but given the wide range of material covered it may have been impractical.",

I learned a lot of practical things from the course and became very sensitive to design - both the good and the bad.  If you have taken a course with Dr. Joyner, you know how enthusiastic he can be, and how active he is in the forums. **HOWEVER**, I think the workload - especially the weekly assignments -  is just a bit too much. Especially if you are like me with tendency to procrastinate but would really like to submit quality work.  If you are a prolific writer, this course is for you. For 10 straight weeks, you have to write and submit a paper.  Then for the last 5 weeks, you work with two of your classmates on a group project, and also write a paper for each of those (you can skip one). You have to review the work of three of your peers every week. And to really understand what is being discussed, you have to read two to three papers every week, which by the way are not too technical.  There is no programming required in this class. There is one group project at the end. \n\nBasis of grade: \n* 30% Homework (10 of them)\n* 30% Tests (2 open-book, open-notes, multiple choice proctored)\n* 30% Projects (1 Individual;  1 group [5-week effort])\n* 10% Participation (Piazza posts, peer reviews, surveys, etc.) \n\nMajority of the students get an 'A'.

            "text": "Nice course and specifically liked the way Leo Mark explains the topics. You will definitely walk away from this class well prepared. Although after more than 10 years in the industry I would rarely use the practices.\n\nThe class covers deeper understanding of the relational algebra, EER, etc. Do not expect concepts of NoSQL, Big Data. Even the indexing is limited to traditional disks. The book has limited use, but definitely recommended if you want to solve/practice similar problems.\n\nThere was a group project, you can choose to create your own groups of 3-4 students. There is a group formation duration, if you are still not in a group you will be assigned one. The project will evaluate your work based on the principles Leo explains in the lectures, so pay attention to those. You can choose any stack to implement, the DB has to be a relational one though (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL). We chose to go with PHP, since rarely anyone of us worked on PHP. Was another learning and we kind of fared well.\n\nExams were the most stressful part, mostly due to ProctorTrack. I didn't have any issues while exam, but have heard from other students that there are hiccups. Exams themselves tested on the learning from the lecture. Good class, could have been better. Leo is great, shame that OMS doesn't have any other class he teaches.",

            "text": "CS-6291 Embedded System Optimization\n(see also: CS-8803 - Embedded Software)\n\n**Course**\n\nI enjoyed the course because I like the material, and I knew what to expect, but some may find the material formidable.\n\nI have completed several OMSCS courses, and can review the course in context with other OMSCS courses. I have software development experience, so I was prepared to take this course. The course introduced new concepts, and reviewed compiler concepts.\n\nEmbedded systems are pervasive and their role can only expand. The course compares CISC and RISC, examines chip complexity for general purpose CPUs versus chip complexity for embedded processors. RISC and especially ARM are the primary focus for most lectures. Issues such as pipeline, register count, datapath, memory and register banks, instruction latency and code size are studied. The volume of material covered is vast.\n\nThe course is presented as three distinct parts. Part one, \"Embedded Systems\" places specific focus on VLIW and VEX and increased parallelism. Topics include Computer Architecture, VLIW, ISA, Datapaths, Registers and Memory, and Branches.  Part two, \"Compilers for Embedded Systems\", presents an overview of compilers, then examines Control Flow Analysis and Liveness Analysis.  This part deals heavily with graph theory, and includes register allocation and liveness analysis (fairly complex topic).\n\nPart three, \"Compiler Optimizations\", is a deeper dive into Register Allocation, Optimizations for Code Size, Differential Register Allocation, Storage Assignment, and Parallelized Load&Store, optimizations which cooperate to improve performance, reduce code size, or decrease power consumption. Innovations expand addressable registers, improve data througput and instruction parallelism through banked memory and registers, DSP and NP specifics, et al. Network Processor optimizations are also considered.\n\n**Lectures & Readings**\n\nThe lectures require substantial time, but are worth watching. Dr. Pande does a good job explaining the material in the lectures. The lectures are dense, and you will spend substantial time each week keeping up with the lectures. Lecture content is back-loaded, and once you complete the first project, the majority of the lectures (and readings) lie ahead. Plan to accelerate your viewing and reading midway through the course.\n\nThe papers (there are a large number of papers), the VLIW and VEX documentation, and the textbook readings provide an enormous volume of material to cover. Be prepared to read, a lot. The volume of readings was overwhelming, nearly abusive.\n\n**Projects**\n\nThere are two substantial projects. Both projects are challenging and require that the student demonstrate understanding of the relevant embedded concepts. The first project took about 50-60 hours (average 60), the second about 30-40 (average 40). Students were given 4-6 weeks for each project.\n\nThe first project was a group project (3 students) to 'schedule' instructions on a VLIW (parallel) machine. The project required parsing the assembler for a substantial subset of the VEX instruction set, rescheduling instructions to preserve semantic behavior, reducing critical path length and thus improve runtime performance. The project required C++, parsing, and graph processing.\n\nThe second project was an individual project where students determine how to improve performance or code size for programs built to run on a Raspberry Pi. This project requires that the student profile code, determine hot functions, choose heuristics, and compile functions for both ARM and THUMB instruction sets based upon heuristics and measurements.\n\nStudents needed a Raspberry Pi 3+, needed to cross-compile for ARM, transfer programs to the Pi, run experiments, and produce a substantial report.\n\n**Homeworks**\n\n*Lest you find time to sleep*, there are four homework assignments to consume your weekends. Each homework consists of multiple parts and demands extensive work and precise attention to detail. The homeworks compel one to deep dive into algorithms presented in lectures and papers. Keep current with lectures and readings and the homeworks will be less painful. One homework required coding, the others merely benefited by writing optional code (write the scripts and automate the manual work, you will be glad you did). Expect to spend 10-20 or more hours on each homework.\n\n**Final Exams**\n\nThe final exam was cumulative. Since the amount of material is enormous, you need to learn the material as you progress through the course. The exam is fair, and tests important concepts explored by projects and homeworks. If you understand the projects and homeworks, the exam holds few surprises. However, the exam is 33% of the course grade, closed book, proctored, and over 3 hours long, so it could be very stressful.\n\n**Overall**\n\n- The amount of work required was enormous.\n- Grading on the first two homeworks was quite brutal.\n- The course requires tons of reading and tons of work.\n- Over half the students who started the course dropped.\n- The high drop rate eviscerated project groups, and forced reorganization.\n- Concepts were not hard to learn, well supported by lectures and readings.\n- Piazza became calmer and the remaining students were very helpful.\n- Office hours were excellent; TAs and Dr. Pande very involved and helpful.\n- Grading was *glacially slow*. One cannot blame the TAs as the assignments are extremely detailed. Some revisions to organization could enable more automated grading.\n\nThe various optimizations can appear chaotic and unrelated, but when you consider them as a variety of approaches to improving various challenges in embedded systems architectures, the course is fairly logical and well organized.\n\nNomenclature aside the homeworks require more time than some projects in other courses. The course has essentially 6 projects. There are some rough patches to the projects and homeworks, so ask questions on Piazza. The TAs were above average, but they do not hold your hand.\n\nOnly one homework was graded by drop date (less than 8% of grade), the third and fourth homeworks were not graded until the middle of final exam week. Grading for the first project was not completed until after the final exam, and the second project and final (50% of grade) are not yet completed.\n\nClass averages were low:\n- homework: 77%, 85%, 80%, 84%\n- project: 90%, ?\n- final: ?\n",

The text books and other readings were not used much at all. The projects were interesting, but the was little to no feedback on them after the were graded - no explanations, examples, or answers - just the instructors private comments. Some of the project requirements are vague, so be VERY careful when answering them. In this case, MUCH more information is better. Some of the test questions were ambiguous and I think one of them was flat out wrong (the \"correct\" answer was actually a sub-set of one of other excluded groups), but the head TA cited some extra material not covered anywhere else to show how they considered this answer \"correct\". You should have taken the Information Security (CS6035) class as a prerequisite as one of the projects leans heavily on material covered there, so definitely NOT a good 1st course. Grading for the class seemed to take way to long (last day of semester and still waiting for a final grade for one assignment). ",

If you want to focus on ML you have to take this class. This class has not been updated in many years... including the exams. There is a lot of ambiguity to the assignments, so expect a grade of 50% to 100% on any given assignment with little certainty of which you will get. You won't have enough time for the midterm, and too much time for the final. You may similarly not feel like you know if you are answering the exam questions properly. \n\nFor grading, the assignments are lenient and the exams less so. I managed to get 100/90/90/90 on the four assignments and at I was shocked at least one of those 90s was not 40. That's just how it goes.\n\nIf you are ok with ambiguity you should make it through without much pain. Hand everything in, even if trash, and you get a B. Stay above the mean most (if not all) of the time and get an A. Improve over time in a noticeable way, as in you start with a 40% on the first assignemnt but finish with 100%, probably get an A. Keep in mind the mean might be 60-70% overall and as low as 50-60% for specific assignments and exams. \n\nI was torn on the rating to give here. I enjoyed much of the class content and Isbell's interactions on slack and piazza, but the mechanics of the class left much to be desired. I've taken classes like GIOS which were amazing in their execution. When I took DVA Joyner was running the class and it was a textbook example of how to run an online class (or _any_ type of class).

You can tell the professor cares about the topic and about the students. The TA crew is phenomenal and there's a dedicated private slack for the course. \n\nThat being said, if you don't know C or can't recall your C-fu from many moons ago then be prepared to double your workload. It's all C, all the time in GIOS. As a web developer, I had forgotten most of the C I had previously learned and probably spent 40+ hours on project 1 but YMMV based on your C competency. You may not enroll as a C developer, but you'll certainly leave as one.\n\nThe exams are difficult and are a combined 55% of your grade. The final had something close to 20 dense lecture hours and the questions were definitely indicative of that.\n\nAll of that may sound ominous but if you put in the work then you're likely going to get at least a B AND learn a ton. There aren't any free lunches in GIOS, but there is a generous curve that rewards those who keep working and stick it out.

            "text": "I would suggest avoiding CS6400 unless you are really interested in relational databases. The content is an introductory/standard dive into relational database theory, but this particular course can be somewhat frustrating. \n\nThe course is set up as 4 exams and 3 group project phases. You will want to consider how tolerant you are of group projects as you may end up doing way more work overall due to low performing group members and the overhead costs of team coordination. People who rate this class highly probably didn't do their share of the group project or only had to pull their own weight as intended. The 4 exams (each 12.5% of total grade) consist of only ~25 multiple-choice questions, but always contain a few obscure corner cases that might not be covered clearly in lectures or book. Thus, it is hard to score really well on the exams. Compounding this is that grading of the exams is asymmetrical such that a multiple select answer easily results in zero points because each checkbox is not graded as a separate choice; thus, exam grades skew low relative to more common grading schemes. Replies specific to course content are usually quickly answered by one designated TA. However, the professor takes a really long time to respond to inquiries about test questions/grading so Piazza gets filled with complaints/negativity. The grade cutoffs are hard at 70/80/90, but points for a few poorly chosen test questions were given back to those on the cusp of the next letter grade. It seems like this class has been run with the same structure for many semesters. Although it is one of the lowest rated OMSCS classes, I suspect that student feedback for revamping the course focus will not be applied anytime soon.\n\nThe 4 exams cover these topics:\n1. Database Fundamentals + (Extended) Entity-Relationship Model. Mean: 82%\n2. EER Relational Mapping. Relational Query Languages (Algebra and Calculus). Mean: 74%\n3. SQL. Mean: 86%\n4. Normalization, Efficiency + Indexing. Mean: 70%\n\nThe 3 phases of group project:\n\nThe group project is an exercise in designing a database and implementing a website. For Fall 2018, the specification was a simple Pinterest clone.\nNo rubrics are given for grading and seem to depend on TAs, but grade averages are very high for the project compared to exams.\n1. Analysis and Specification. This phase was a bit ambiguous in parts. Expectations on what was required around some of the task decomposition and database locks were not clear. Likewise, no direction is given on how to write the abstract code so it is hard to coordinate team members and produce a consistent report. I did enjoy making the information flow, EER (and later EER to Relation) diagrams since this type of visual language/diagramming was new to me and explained clearly in the course materials (unlike the aforementioned topics); however, I don’t anticipate it being directly useful to me in the future.\n2. Abstract Code, SQL and EER to Relation Mapping. This phase was very rushed. You had to learn the majority of the course material in a few weeks in order to complete this phase (and also had to learn relational algebra/calculus for the exam concurrently with this project phase). I felt this phase was the most stressful since there was so much material to learn in only 3 weeks. I did not know much SQL before the course and did come out with a fairly deep understanding/practical experience writing queries due to phase 2.\n3. Implementation. This is the phase where I did not do anything related to this class for 4-5 weeks aside from taking the 3rd exam. I had already learned SQL in order to complete the prior phase and this part was just implementing a website (suggested to use PHP and sample stack). I had not used PHP before, but was able to code the majority of the website to full spec in 2-3 days before the deadline. This phase also made the least sense to me from a content perspective. It is all work completely unrelated to databases aside from the fact that you happened to be using raw SQL queries, which were already written in phase 2. I still can’t believe over a month of this class is dedicated to making a basic website when so many important database topics (NoSQL, etc.) were left completely uncovered. \n\nThe final week of the course was left to study the practice exam and discuss material for Exam 4, which covered the topics of Normalization, Efficiency and Indexing.

You can see the syllabus for Fall 2018 term at http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/fall-2018/ .\n\nThe class content is interesting but a bit theoretical; while it's grounded in AI, and you'll find examples of such topics when doing other AI classes, it's hard to really apply what is taught in the lessons to most of the things you'll do in the class.\n\nThe course revolves around three homeworks, which are 10-page written essays about both class topics and other thems, three projects, which is actually the evolution of more or less the same task (creating an agent for solving Raven's progressive matrices, with harder and harder problems while going on), and three open-book, proctored one-hour exams.\n\nHomeworks are interesting; they invite you to actually reflect about various topics.\n\nThe Raven's solver is interesting as well. You'll need to experiment with various techniques in order to solve the different kinds of problems around. I didn't especially like the \"implementation points\" section, but actually it seems that it's mostly free points for many people, so, it's not bad either. You must write a report along your implementation, and that report is 50% of your project score.\n\nPersonally, I didn't like the exams. They felt more about wordplay and discerning ambiguities, rather than verifying if people understood or knew some content. But that doesn't mean they're overwhelming difficult.\n\nYou can mostly frontload work, since the syllabus is complete from the beginning, but while you can implement your agent, you won't be able to test it his \"matching\" set from the beginning, so you may be forced to revisit it later on. \n\nAll in all: a solid, well run, medium-difficulty, interesting class.\n\n",

Each week you have to write an 8 page paper, read some articles, and do peer reviews. If you follow the prompts exactly for the papers, then you can easily get 100% on the papers. If you actually do the readings it will take you twice as long as the prof estimates for the readings, unless you are very familiar with the subject matter already. Because of this I stopped reading the articles after test 1 and just skimmed them before the last test. You have to earn 100 participation points by the end of the semester, but I earned mine all by week 5 by taking classmates' surveys. There are 2 tests, multiple choice, open notes/internet. Group project at the end was more hassle than it was worth to me because one of my group members was not participating and had no clue what was going on. Overall the HCI subject matter was really interesting but the busy work nature of the weekly tasks made me feel like I was just checking boxes rather than engaging with the material. If you don't mind checking boxes for 15 weeks, I'd say this was by far the easiest of the 4 classes I've taken thus far in the program. It was an easy A. ",

            "text": "This was a very hard class, but hard based on the way the class is run / the grading scheme.  \n\nPros: The concepts aren't particularly difficult, and they are interesting.  It's also nice to have a class where you are thinking a lot and sitting down working through problems on pen and paper.  Most other classes in the program end up requiring hours in front of a computer coding (it is CS afterall!).  Also, the TAs were very helpful for the most part, and tried to aid in the understanding of the material.  And based on the way the class is run, you do learn the material in intimate detail.  What I mean by that is...\n\nCons: The exams are worth 85% of the grade.  For Fall 2018, there were two mid-terms and a cumulative final.  The exams are graded strictly, and often with a bit over zestfully (word?) by the TAs.  There was then vague guidance regarding requesting regrades that amounted to threats to take poitns away if the regrade wasn't submitted with the right justification.  The final was then worth 35% of the grade.  Because of this, it was a make-or-break type of exam.  I was in the same boat with a lot of people in that a B was required to pass and then graduate.  The last few weeks leading up to the final were spent studying every waking minute... which led to a detailed understanding of the material.  I ended up with a B (64, 77, and 79 on the respective tests), and there was a fairly generous curve in the end which helped a lot of people on the edge of a B/C. \n\nOverall:  You do learn a lot.  Just expect to be stressed until the end in order to get the B needed in most OMSCS specialties to graduate. But to end on a high note, if you start off in the class and don't do well on the first test or two, don't give up!  Keep studying hard and stick it out until the end.  It is still likely you will get a B if you keep trying and show improvement over the semester.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel and you CAN graduate (if it's your last class)!\n\n",

They were well structured, and had just enough framework in place that you had to do around 50% of the work to complete the project, but didn't have to reinvent the wheel (for parts that built on previous parts, there was either code or binaries to fill in the previous work).  Exams were very fair, but take them seriously - they are written in such a way that you can't BS your way through them.  They really do test your knowledge...\n\nI would highly recommend this course as a first course.",

Due to overwhelming evidence of problems in HWs and Exams, they use grade inflation to solve the problem.  When you have 7 TAs, everyone is counting on others to address issues.   No issues were addressed and there were so many.  One TA said prof had 20 years of teaching experience and is very good.  I believe it, does the TA not realize that TAs are the center of the complains?  Professor is still responsible for hiring unqualified TAs and does not audit their sloppy work.",

If you make a good study guide, understand the concepts, and watch the TA video before you should do fine.

If one realizes, the videos are a distillation of the required reading.  It is a very well-run class with excellent TAs whose enthusiasm will just spillover to the class.  Office hours are something I look forward to, and definitely regret missing.  \n\nAssignments are tough but doable - these actually test the intimate understanding of a topic - a great way to learn.  Not only do you \"know\" something - you actually get to do something.  \n\nProjects are tough but fun!  It takes A LOT of time - but with proper time management - it should be doable - they give a month to finish a project!  With the difficulty of the project comes learning also. \n\nFinally the final exam is super tough - but that will be a true test of your understanding of the course.  Read and internalize the lessons.  No such thing as winging it.\n\nThe course will lay the foundations for RL - but will leave you yearning for more time to cover more material and to explore more things in depth.  By going through the class though, you're likely be in a state capable to go about exploring and getting more information, or exploiting what you already know.  Either way you should be able to reap some rewards.",

            "text": "Every aspect of this class failed to live up to the standards I expect from a GT grad program (online or not).\n\ntldr; Don't take this class unless you have to.\n\nThis class is not hard. It is poorly designed and poorly administrated. I averaged 18 hours a week on it and got a B. That should be broken down to 6 hours of productive work and 12 hours of frustration/time wasted. On almost every lab, some requirement was elaborated on in a piazza thread by the instructor in a way that changed the approach to doing the lab.\n\nI'll start with the positives to be fair. This is a very interesting topic. I enjoyed learning about it in spite of the way the course was being run. The scope of the material is ambitious and that is not a bad thing.  The slack channel was very helpful and active because nothing brings people together like complaining about the same things.\n\nOn the other hand:\nWeekly quizzes and the final are checking if you can use ctrl+F effectively on slides/papers. Most questions are word for word from a lecture or paper except usually with a trick like one word had been changed. Many questions do not use logically sound English.\n\nLabs requirements aren't well communicated. (One lab's write-up was an 106 page slide deck smh). If you happen to be very familiar with the topic ahead of time you will probably get by. If you are not familiar your best bet is another student walking you through it. The lecture material does not. The lab material was heplful maybe half the time. These topics include python, javascript, chrome extenstions, HTML, CSS, Disassembly code,  android architecture, Regex, Machine Learning basics.  \n\nThe lectures are barely worth mentioning because they do little more than provide a 2 minute version of the topics you'll have to do a whole lab on. They aren't really good or bad. You need to watch them for the final/quizzes which will test how well you can memorize random statements out of them. \n\nI'll give the instructor and TAs the benefit of the doubt that they were doing their best to make a good class, but that was not the result. Poor requirements and incorrect grading created a negative feedback loop on piazza very quickly. Students got angry. The staff got defensive. Nobody had a good time. Learning suffered. \n\n",

I feel lectures are more general, rather giving detail about the topic will just brief you. If anyone taking this course I would not recommend to rely on the lectures. \n\nTA are helpful, they try to answer the question but somehow I feel even they are not very confident while answering the questions. For me slack and piazza worked very well.\n\nFrom assignment point of view there are total 4 of them. For each of them you have to write min 10 pages covering your analysis along with graphs. That said one can copy entire code from the internet but need to tweak it to generate some nice graphs. I will recommend to cover whatever information you gather about the topic for which you are writing about. Sometime I don't feel TA are even reading the entire report as per the feedback they have commented on some point which was already there in the report. So its better to write about everything rather than shooting an arrow in the dark. \n\nExam: there will be two closed book exam out of which mid term will be cumalative. Exams are really tough so one need to prepare really well for them and on top of that those are subjective. These are really good quality exam so be prepared before taking them. \n\nGrades: One can't figure out what grade are you gonna end up with.

Bonus for those of us with jobs - the ability to study ahead, the last half of the units was released mid-semester.\n\nThe midterm was reasonable (not all 4 hours were needed), the final was awfully long and difficult (to make up for the midterm I guess?), I'm talking 4 hours, all proctortracked, going as fast as humanly possible, and still not having enough time to finish everything.

I've been disappointed in the program as a whole, and just want to finish up as quickly as possible with easy courses, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this course quite engaging. This was is no small part due to the TAs, who were extraordinarily active on slack and piazza, and very quick with grading. \n\nPros:\n- TAs were great. This will vary between semesters, so I guess Fall 2018 people were just lucky.\n- Projects were engaging. In the first project you get to put on your hacker hat and do a buffer overflow attack (minimal C required), which was awesome (around 10 hours, including writeup). The second project involves some malware analysis (about 4 hours). Third project is hacking RSA encryption, which was way more fun than expected (around 10 hours), and the fourth project was hacking a webpage (8 hours or so if you have javascript experience, but if you don't know JS you could potentially spend way more time on it). \n- You have regular open book quizzes. These are great from a pedagogical perspective - regular checks on understanding help you study more frequently, and make you engage with the material more. \n\nCons:\n- The lectures are a little boring. The first half are kind of common sense, while the second half are very dry and mathematical. \n\nOverall, this was one of my favorite courses I've taken at GT. It's a very light workload, but the projects will make you think, and I feel great now that I finally understand RSA. I paired it with computer networks, and feel that I could have taken a 3rd easy course at the same time. \n\n",

            "text": "Background: Developer in big data, but not ML per se. With MS on a different CS/EE track. Took ML alone Fall 2018.\n\nOMS exp: Took DVA, AI, ML4T\n\nheard about the difficulty of this course so I took some introductory courses e.g. DVA and ML4T before trying this. Overall an OK course, not as great as I expected, but not too bad either. Assignment format is writing report with ~10 pages, which is less time consuming than coding. I usually spend an entire weekend to finish each report after finishing video watch and paper/book reading. For AI course, I needed an entire week to finish each coding project.\n\nPros:\n1. Provided an umbrella-like coverage on various ML topics: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning and game theory.\n2. 4 reports/assignments help facilitate deeper understanding on different ML models and performances.\n3. Some very interesting topics that you can get deeper understanding here: randomized optimization, game theory, mdp.\n\nCons:\n1. No coding at all. This is personal, as a developer, I'd prefer to write some code to understand how things work. This course is designed more for researchers I guess, that you need to worry more about metrics, performance measures, and model comparisons etc.\n2. Exams are hard, but curve are generous and there are extra points for each of the 2 exams too. Midterm gives very little time to complete so you need to fly though. Final is better but you still don't have time to re-check your answers.\n3. some exam questions are asking you to recite concepts/definition instead of checking your understanding. so you either know it or not.\n4. Report feedback is not that helpful. there's no clear cubic defined in terms of points deduction. Seems random and it's very normal that you see comments like \"you need to include xxx in your report\", but it was never stated anywhere that you should.\n5. Discourage of re-grading, despite of seemingly-random points deduction/assignment.\n\nTips: get familiar with some ML library e.g. sklearn, this will save you a lot of time on writing report than if you learn from scratch.\n\nOverall a good course, but don't expect to get too much from it if you're already familiar with most of ML field or if you just wanted to get your hands dirty writing code. Stay above average in most of the exams/assignments will almost guarantee your an A, exams are taking 50% of the final grade so need to pay more attention to.\n\n",

            "text": "Video lectures: There are much better lectures on YouTube - Andrew NG for ML and Silver for RL. The lectures are superficial and pander to math phobia of students. Don't expect any deep insights from lectures. Instructor says this is by design as the course is a survey course. However, I have taken several survey courses before (this is my second graduate degree) and none were this shallow. The bigger problem, however, is that these video lectures were recorded in 2014 and have not been revised since then to incorporate any feedback from students. The professor thinks everything is just perfect.\n\nThe Professor: He is an egomaniac who thinks he has optimized everything and there is nothing left for him to improve. He derives particular pleasure by putting down his students - your questions will usually draw some sarcastic putdown. His interaction with students on Piazza and Slack is mostly snark. Some students love it but several just go quiet and don't ask questions. To make it worse, his TAs have started emulating his snarky style, which is definitely above their pay-grade (yes, Himanshu - I am referring to you).\n\nAssignments: I like the open ended nature of assignments but in some cases the volume of asks was repetitive and didn't make any sense. As with the videos, these assignments have not been revised for years and any student feedback is sarcastically dismissed. To those who saying that these 12-page reports are like real-life research reports, my only question is if they have ever seen one? I mean they are OK as a learning exercise but to equate them to research papers is a bit of a hyperbole. And so is any claim of how this course has validated people's life choices, made ML their new love, and similar bs. \n\nUnless you are gifted, plan on putting in at least 30-40 hours of work per week to ensure an A. \n\nExams: Midterm (mean 49) is designed to fail students, but the grading is very liberal - people get points for putting black on white. If this was not true, the class mean would be probably 20 points lower. Final (mean 51) is more like a traditional exam and fair, but grading is tougher. You don't get points for writing any bs. Exams are closed book everything and you are not even allowed to have a pen and scratch paper - a ridiculous requirement as some people use scratch paper not for doing calculations but to formulate their thoughts.\n\nGrading: Grading is fair on the whole but some graders are much harder than others. It is easy to get 80 - 90. But to get above 90 and how many points you lose going from 90 to 100 is a crap shoot depending on the grader.\n\nIn summary - while the course may deliver on its promise to provide you with a survey of ML, there are better resources and better instructors out there to achieve the same goal. The only value add in this course is assignments. The professor has structured testing of learning outcomes to unnecessarily have a high cognitive overhead - you will never get time to reflect on what you have learned and it would be race from one deliverable to the next.\n",

If you do 99% of the assignment right but a few small details, they mark off like 50%. A large portion of the group project grade is based on whether your group members said you contributed. Me and another group member did 95% of the group project work through out the project but because other group members scrambled the night that it was due and we didn't, they said that we didn't contribute.

For one assignment, I was one day late due to a late start and a seemingly easy issue that I can't get correct answer in piazza discussions. I struggled with this little problem until finally the professor pointed to the issue. I fixed it and submitted the assignment, but got half credit. I did feel that one of the course video is misleading that caused this mistake. \nLike some others have pointed out, you will be surprisingly got a low score for some unimportant minor things. I got a low score for another assignment, and even wanted to withdraw the course. Luckily, I stick to to it, and scored a lot better in later assignments and projects. I admitted that I learned a lot from this course, git, java, android, some database UML, whitlebox/blackbox testing, and most important of all, never give up.\nEventually, I got A despite some mistakes or unfortunate situations.

The tests were challenging and very tedious but I think they matched the level of difficulty required for a course to be considered \"graduate level\".  The projects were also interesting if you've never taken an AI course before.  However, the projects focus on \"reinventing the wheel\" topics like Minimax, Alpha-Beta, Decision Trees, etc.  I would have liked to see more challenging projects where we used these techniques to implement more complex programs instead of writing our own algorithms from scratch.\n\nThe TAs held office hours pretty regularly and each project has a TA office hour session where they would go over the provided code & the project description.  I didn't find these super helpful but if you've never seen Python code before, they might be beneficial to you.\n\nProfessor Starner also held office hours occasionally and these were pretty interesting.  One of his office hours’ double as a mini-lesson on some advanced topics not directly mentioned in the course.\n\nOverall, I think this is a good course if you have a basic knowledge of programming (Python preferred) and are willing to spend a lot of effort on the projects.\n\nI took this class with a full-time job and would not recommend taking this with another class (if you work full-time).",

            "text": "Overall, this course was very good and is a great first course. The material was well thought out and the assignments are great. Below are my thoughts on different areas of the course.\n\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tests were honestly my least favorite part of this class. The first test was the midterm and we were given previous tests and their correct answers. Memorizing those was all you needed to do to get an A. For the final, we were asked to create a question on a specific subject in the course depending on our last name. After this, all of the questions that were student generated were sent out and we were required to grade 5 of them. Once this was over, the professor gave out all of the ratings. I studied the ones that had a score of 4+ and 3 or more ratings. This ended up being 250 questions. Doing this, I was able to get a 27/30 on the final. Overall, depending on your approach, the tests could have been more of a regurgitation of material rather than actual understanding of material. Not to say that memorizing these questions doesn't help with understanding of material. But, you get the point. \n\nTL;DR you can memorize material and do well\n\n\n### [Assignments](http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Fall_2018#Assignments)\n\nThe assignments were great & had awesome documentation / resources on how to complete them. There were 8 assignments total ranging from easy to very challenging in difficulty. The difficulties were given on the course wiki & I found them to be accurate. The first few assignments were great for getting me up to speed in python. The later ones were more difficult and reinforced material learned in the lectures. The assignments do start to build on themselves, so do not get behind. I started all of them very early & was able to finish them days before the due date. This was good because they did have reports that you needed to write after finishing the code. \n\nTL;DR start them early & check piazza -> you'll do well. \n\n\n### Piazza\nGood once you sorted through the countless duplicate posts. I had very little patience / empathy for people who continuously posted duplicate questions. Other than that, it was very active with good posts. The TAs & professor answered quickly and with good responses. If something comes off as offensive, don't take it personally. There are participation checks for Piazza. So make sure you're posting & reading posts through the app or website. Also, make sure you use the correct email in the settings. Your actual GaTech email, not the alias. Visit the site daily so you know where questions / answers are. This will be helpful and beneficial for projects. \n\nTL;DR read posts, ask questions, make sure your email is correct -> you'll do well. \n\n#### Do: \n* Watch lectures - Udacity\n* Start projects early \n* Post on piazza \n* Study for exams early \n\n#### Don't: \n* POST DUPLICATES ON PIAZZA\n* Start projects late. You have time. You always have time. Just. Do. It.  \n* Forget to check piazza or wiki before asking a question \n* Ask questions that you could easily search on piazza \n* Say 'Sorry if this is a duplicate, but...' because you will get a response tagging another post with your question. The TA's don't have time for you inability to search. Seriously. ",

            "text": "This was my first course at GATech. There is zero programming, so it is great for someone who is not strong in that area. There is a LOT of reading and an 8-page paper due each week. There are prompts for the papers, and other than deciding on the topic, the papers generally write themselves. Don't get fancy with the writing. Answer the questions they ask you to answer in the order they ask you to answer them. \n\nThere are two tests. They are open book. They brought my average down, but not enough to make a difference.  (I averaged over 99% on my writing/projects, but 85% on the tests, which are worth 30%.)  A HUGE frustrating part of the course is that you never get to see the exams, so you have no idea what you got wrong. Also, the questions were very  open to interpretation at times, but you can never see if you were right/wrong in your answer, so that is very very frustrating. I wish I could tell you why I struggled on the tests (I was too literal in the interpretation of the questions, or maybe not literal enough -- who knows???)  Personally, I think this should not be allowed. There is no \"check\" on the system. You just have to take the professor's word on your grade. Not good.\n\nThere are two projects. An individual 12-page paper and a 30-page group project. Not too bad because they follow from all the assignments that had been done up to that point.\n\nDon't let the low hours fool you. Some weeks I spent 20+ hours reading, writing, watching videos, doing peer reviews. There are literally 100-200 pages of reading to do each week, and 2-3 hours of video. Don't get behind on the reading/videos! The reading, while at times boring, really helps explain the ideas of the videos. It all matters on the exams!! Readings are 1/3 of the exams.\n\nOverall, great class. Great TAs. Great instructor. Very well-organized. Highly recommend it.",

            "text": "Please note that this is a review for the \"new\" DVA course which is shared between OMSA and OMSCS starting Fall 2018.\n\nIf you are a first semester student, read this review thoroughly to understand what you are getting into - in this course, if you do not stay on the ball, you would be thrown for a spin.\n\nLet's begin with the facts of the course. This should answer some commonly asked questions.\n\n- True to its name, the course covers visualization of data and big data analytics\n- On the conceptual end, it covers aspects of human-computer interaction (HCI) relevant to visualizing data, Data Cleaning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Graph Analytics and Text Analytics. The material is not very mathematical. So, brushing up on math is not a prerequisite\n- On the technical end, you would use D3.js, Hadoop (HDFS, Pig and Hive), Spark, Python (not R) and several other tools\n- Professor Chau was very involved and easily accessible via Piazza throughout the class\n- The TA'ing was very good - if you ignore a hiccup here and there, it was top notch\n- 50% of the grade is homeworks while the other 50% is the group project. There are quizzes for 3% extra credit. There are no exams\n- You get 3 weeks to finish and submit each homework. There are 3 weeks for the project final report at the end but the project runs in parallel with everything with deliverables spread throughout the semester\n- There are several office hours spread across the week and are conducted on Slack\n- Project teams are 4-6 people (larger teams with permission) and self-selected. Aim for the higher number since many teams end up with 2-3 people due to withdrawals and that can result in a lot of work.  Your team can have people from both OMSCS and OMSA.\n\nNow for my opinion of the course. The course is very well organized and a must-take for anyone doing the ML specialization. The lectures are informative and the assignments are designed to give you practical experience in what you are learning, though assignments do not cover everything learned. Note that lectures are only available to OMSCS students on Canvas which means you cannot access them before the start of semester.\n\nThe difficulty of this course comes, not from complexity but,  from the amount of work you are required to do. The key to succeed is to start every assignment early - every homework has a lot of setup steps and each question can require you to learn something new. For example, for a single homework, you are expected to learn Hadoop HDFS, Pig, Hive, Spark Dataframes, Azure and AWS etc. within a 3 week period - in addition to the lectures and project work. If you cannot ramp up your knowledge fast enough, this course is not for you.\n\nD3.js merits its own section. IMHO it is poorly documented and that adds to the amount of work you need to put in. The Scott Murray tutorial is a nice beginning but takes you nowhere near the complexity you face in the assignments.

I work 40+ hours per week, and have a family as many in the program do; the way I make this work is that I have to adhere to a pretty strict schedule...I go to bed early and get up early, but now with group work, I have to change schedule to meet up and do work at a time I'm pretty much dead to the world.  For working professionals, this is a ridiculous requirement; I can only assume the main motivation behind group work is so that there are fewer projects to grade.  As another reviewer mentioned, the grading was glacial in this course; 6-7 weeks to get some grades back.  There is no possibility to learn from mistakes and correct before making the same mistakes again.  Also the UML portion felt like a complete waste.  I took the course as a requirement, if you have any experience you will likely learn little to nothing.",

            "text": "Not sure where to start. The class itself focuses more on teaching you about computer networks in general rather than teaching you to work with them and doing projects in networking. 7 projects, of which 4 are python based, need little coding (maximum I coded was maybe 3-4 pages in total for the course but you must understand python and programming to know what you are doing). You will enjoy the class and if you are comfortable with python and know basics about networking you will learn new things and it will be an easy class for you. Tests are easy too. The overall structure of the class is very well laid out though some projects may require you to spend a weekend (20-30hrs) to make sure you get full grade for them. Since most projects are autograded, if you do well on them the class should bag you an easy B and little more effort should get you a very comfortable A.\n\nNow this semester the class had to go through some issues. Stacia Stokes (the head TA) was let go in the middle of the semester and it seemed like she was pretty much ticking all the right boxes as a head TA so nobody understood what happened. After that the class went a little numb for a while. Projects 2-3 had videos to help students complete the projects made by stacia which were super helpful but once she was let go, the videos for later projects made by some other TA were terrible. They were not clear and it may not be the TAs fault probably the course just had management issues so nobody knew what was going on. So the class definitely ran into problems mid semester.\n\nOnce that happened in order to literally make up for they threw an additional 7% extra grade points. You literally had to do nothing but give feedback on the class VM to get 6% of the 7%. This meant almost everyone would get an A or a B since the official class already had a 5% extra graded portion for the last project. So 12% extra grade was just ridiculous and made the class too easy to get an A. The 7% will most likely not be there next semester cause it felt like a lame attempt to convince students not to badly rate the class anyway.\n\nAll in all I would probably still suggest this class if you want to learn some interesting stuff about Computer Networks. The class may not be helpful for anything real world since it just briefly teaches all the concepts and doesn't go deep into something but it should be an easy class for a semester if you dont want too much work load. Easy B. Little more effort and comfortable A.",

This reflects on the TAs' behavior and the overall quality of the course. There is a lot of writing involved, which it was a plus for me as I love it. But it is something to consider if you don't like writing that much. There is simply no way around it as all homeworks and projects require a 10-page essay. The course was taken on Fall 2018, and some changes were introduced to the course in relation to past semesters. For example, the projects used to have a curve and be graded solely on the performance of the AI agent submitted. For this semester, that component was reduced to be 30% of the grade, with another 20% coming from the improvement progress presented and the other 50% from the essay about the submitted agent. I hear the professor is considering some other changes that, if implemented, in my opinion, will improve the course even more for future semesters.\n\nThis is one of those courses that one gets back what ones puts in. On my case, I ended up putting over 30 hours/week, not by necessity for the A, but simply because it is a subject that interests me a lot. But I can see people still getting the A with maybe 12-16 hours/week. Especially if you come with a solid Python background. Not a difficult course for an A, supper interesting topic, engaged students and great professor. Can't go wrong with that combo!",

Therefore, in my opinion, there is too strong of an emphasis given to it; while some other topics of SW process are not even mentioned (code review is one that comes to mind). Especially since there is another course that is focused on SW test only. Didn't like the TAs. The vast majority of the Piazza replies from them were single sentenced referring students to other posts, even though they could clearly add more value to the topic if they bothered spending more than 5 seconds on the response. This is usually a reflection on the importance the professor gives to the course and the students. \n\nIt would take an average of about 8 weeks for grades to come out. Which makes even less sense when the quality of the feedback given is taken into account. The TAs could easily be replaced with auto-graders as they clearly followed a very strict (and obscure) rubric with no variations/exceptions and provided no feedback on the assignment other than \"great job\" if you got 100% or three-word sentences referring to a rubric that the students don't have access to when you got something wrong on an assignment. Flat out ridiculous. This created a fabricated level of difficulty to the class, which I think they realized later in the course and gave the opportunity for a 20% extra credit on the individual project for something that was supper easy to obtain.\n\nEven if you are going through this program only for the degree and care very little about what you learn; save your money by selecting something else. There are other courses that offer an easy A but are not as wasteful of your time and money as this one.\n",

She gave me ridiculous inaccurate women's m documents at the beginning of every semester, which I sent I hours correcting. Sam, another TA, created the horrible VM that caused all of the problems my last semester. I didn't throw him under the bus a but I shouldn't have released that VM despite his condescending, bullying remarks that pressured me to release it. I had no support, so I released it and it resulted in chaos I'm be fall 2018.",

The financial portions of the course are helpful and important to understand in the business world. The lectures are a ton of videos to watch on edX, and the office hours consist of a brief review of material followed by Q&A. I recommend watching both the lectures and office hours (at a later date) at 2x speed. Take some notes or use some notes from previous semesters and review those for the exams -- this will save a lot of time compared to going back through the videos. The first exam was harder than the second, it contained a good amount of finance formulas that you will need to memorize. Overall, the course could be improved a lot (more project/case based work) but it's not too difficult if you stay on top of the content. ",

For the tests, study the lectures and papers in the week they were assigned, don't wait to the end or you won't be able to finish study on time.\n\nOverall I loved the course, but I don't consider it an easy course (to pair with a harder course for example), however this is my first course and I don't have anything to compare with.",

He holds office hours regularly and is present on Piazza and participates in discussions.  The readings cover the required material, and although difficult to understand at times are adequate to complete most of the homework and projects.\n\nThe course is extremely difficult.  The grading is inconsistent (different TAs), and not timely in any way.  Project 1 and 2 grades were not available until after the final exam.  The homework grades for 3 and 4 were available a day or two before the final.  \n\nProject 1 is a relatively difficult assignment to write in C++ a scheduler to reschedule a VEX assembly file using a variety of different scheduling methods.  Test early and often, as the testing is non-trivial and non-obvious.  The grading was relatively reasonable, but as mentioned above it was not graded until the end of the course.  This is also a group project and groups were formed and reformed as students dropped.  An extension was given due to this.\n\nProject 2 is an analysis project -- basically take code provided by the course and run it on a Raspberry Pi and analyze it.  Then adjust the mix of instruction types and test again and again using different methods.  It's non-trivial, but not difficult.  Again, not graded until after the final exam.\n\nThe homeworks were difficult and grading was not timely.\n\nThe final exam is comprehensive, proctored with proctortrack, and very difficult.  \n\nUnfortunately we had little idea what our grades would be until after the final was graded and posted.  You get no chance to figure out if you should drop the course until it's weeks too late.  \n\nLearned a great deal, it's a good course but a difficult one, hopefully better TAs in the future will resolve some of the grading issues and make it a little better to deal with.

TAs were supportive, but did not really encourage creativity. I noticed that some of my fellow classmates got rude answers for questioning assignment structure or when they tried to come up with alternate ideas for implementing. It would have helped if the assignments gave more information about the algorithms we were trying to implement, because they were totally tangential to lecture material.\n\nAs others had noted, instructor was mostly absent, but she was the most helpful and the most respecting of students. She tried her best to clarify on doubts just before the exams and also helped us wade through tough papers.\n\nThis is a class to get good grades(IMO), you just have to scramble a bit every two weeks to submit a project and exams were mostly easy.\nRight now, it is not a good class to learn about networking, but if the lectures and assignments are revamped(as the instructor kept promising), this course has potential to become a better one.",

            "text": "I think the course was one of the most informative in OMSCS (obviously more-so if concentrating in ML) and very well taught by Isbell and Littman.  They supply a lot of detail in the lectures and supplement that with many external readings (generally optional, but are very beneficial to understanding the theories). \n\nThe course is pretty tough up front and mellows out a bit towards the end.  Projects require minimal code (theoretically zero depending how you approach it) and are focused more on the write-ups and understanding of the concepts.  \n\nBe prepared to spend a lot of time on projects (especially on the first one). Once you get the feedback from that one, you will understand how to approach the rest.\n\nMidterm and Final were quite challenging with mean grades in the 30s and 40s respectively.   In the end it's hard to assess how you are doing in the course, but the \"curve\" is quite generous and Isbell/Littman make it very clear if you should stay in the course or not.  As long as you are understanding the material and can portray that, I'd say a B is very doable; even if your grades do not seem that way.",

I also might have spent more time than other students as I was relatively new to Python. I'd imagine being able to concentrate on learning the concepts rather than learning Python too would be nice. \n\nYou get to learn 6 concepts in depth through the programming assignments. However the lectures and readings cover numerous other subjects, and those are all fair game on the midterm and final. For example, there were a few videos on neural networks (~10 minutes) and no projects covering it. However, there was a 10/100 point question on the final on it. This (the breadth of topics covered and the details you must know on the topics) makes it difficult to know where to ask questions ahead of time as using most outside course material is not allowed. \n\nOverall, there are 10+ hours of lectures per week, ~100 pages from the text book per week, challenge questions every week to review on Piazza (not graded), and projects due every 2 weeks. It's a lot to keep up with.\n\nThe TAs are very helpful/active on Piazza, and there the projects are all doable in 2 weeks- even for a Python novice like myself. \n\nThe grading seemed to cause some stress, since it's based on the median and standard deviation, but rest assured that above a 90% is an A and above an 80% is at least a B.

There's plenty of supporting content and recommended texts if you want to learn more about a particular topic. TAs are awesome. Joyner is awesome. Piazza is active.\n\n**Homework** 3 writing assignments that cover a mix of concepts, applying the concepts, and ethics in AI/ML. Can work ahead and knock these out early which is nice.\n\n**Exams** 3 exams which cover concept definitions, applied examples, and details about specific concepts. Very much a Joyner exam if you've taken one of his courses before. Open everything with a 1 hour time limit. No curve.\n  \n**Projects**  You build an AI agent that can solve Raven's matrices problems (intelligence test problems). The project is broken into three phases, and you submit your agent along with a reflection/write up through the semester.  The project was interesting, but I didn't change my agent's strategy after the first submission. I recommended taking the visual approach from the start. It's a little more work up front, but you have to use the visual approach on the third phase of the project.\n\nFuture iterations might have a different project focused on NLP. Would love to see that.  \n\n**Pre-reqs** You don't need a ton of background to do well in the course. Some experience programming in Python or Java will help. If using Python, you'll make extensive use of the PIL library for processing and working with images if the Raven's project stays as the core project in the course.",

Most of the grade so do well on them. You can't work ahead. Project specifications are clear. Lots of unnecessary, repeated questions about projects on Piazza. Read the project docs closely and watch any project videos the TAs share. These go a long way to help you understand what you have to do. I liked the 2nd and 3rd projects on writing distributed network algorithms; they were the most interesting projects with Python coding. The last three projects required more configuration and less coding.\n\n**Homework** None\n\n**Instruction** While the lecture videos are clear, the diagrams and text on the screen is generally messy. Could be better. TAs were helpful on Piazza. The professor was largely absent until midway through the course when the head TA (Stacia) was let go. Stacia was great, and the TAs always responded quickly. I didn't experience VM problems but some students did.\n\n**Pre-reqs** None.

            "text": "This course was interesting. The projects feel similar to an industry project as they are open-ended and require you to back up your statements in the report. The first 3 projects use the same data sets doing different things (supervised learning, optimization, and clustering) while the final project is a reinforcement learning problem. The midterm was pretty rough but the final was much easier. \n\nA few tips for people getting ready to take the class:\n\n1. Use JonTay's code repo. Yes, it's stealing code but this is one of the few times this is allowed in the program. You may learn more by programming it yourself but honestly not much more (as you shouldn't really program the algorithms yourself anyways). Using this repo likely cuts 10-20 hrs off per project. Several times I tried to get more own solution working than gave up and spent more time running additional experiments.\n\n2. Trust the curve. It will change every time but you can expect to pass the class unless you are near 10% (seriously, I got a 65% in the course and wound up with an A). \n\n3. Pick data sets early. Choose binary classification data sets.Don't use messy data unless you're really looking for a challenge.\n\nOverall, I think this course and AI are great to take to understand the basics from theory, implementation, and application. While I enjoyed the AI course more (and felt like I learned more in that course) this course helps you tie it all together and understand the big picture of data science problems. On top of that, Isbell is a great instructor and very helpful (in a sarcastic way) and the videos are a joy to watch.",

            "text": "This course took a different approach compared to conventional classes. The focus of this class is to enhance the student's ability to take information and logically draw conclusions/synthesize new information out domain knowledge/presented material. As such, the lecture style consists of two professors conversing on the topic with one taking the role of lecturer and the other taking the role of the student. The approach is effective for those who derive understanding from thinking about the material, and significantly less so for those who are book/memorization learners. Note that this review comes from the perspective of a student in the former classification.\n\nWhere this class falls flat on its face is the homework assignments. There are four in total, consisting of a coding section (where plaigarism of the code is openly encouraged) and an analysis section. The analysis is a 10-12 page writeup (each consisting of 10-15% of the total course grade) and is extremely subjective. Feedback and grades received vary widely across TAs and is entirely the luck of the draw (based on small sample size, it seems to be uniformly distributed between 50 and 100). As such, when approaching the complation of homeworks one needs to realize that the work is less about the grade (more on completion) and more about how the algorithm would be applied to a real data set/explained to a bystander. All homeworks are made available at the beginning of the course, but for a working professional it will be a struggle to stay on track with lectures and homeworks, let alone getting ahead.\n\nExams are focused on how a student would apply the algorithms learned in class to (what should be) a problem that has not been viewed before. This may sometimes extend to simple calculations or even pseudocode, but tend to be very fair in terms of no surprises. Despite this, the exams are quite difficult to non-coders nonetheless. There are two optional problem sets whose problems are more closely related to the exam questions. These are often skipped but in a more conventional class would have been the focus of the graded homeworks and the current graded homeworks reworked into a semester-long project.\n\nOverall, an effective course in terms of teaching material, but the grading structure may be a shock to students who may be used to performing well. Even if the grade appears to be bad, as long your grade appears to be within one standard deviation, a B can be expected. Simply completing all of the homeworks and attempting the exam should net at least a passing C grade.",

            "text": "This course is an overview of deterministic optimization algorithms with a few of their real-world applications. They would typically be presented in a general form, but then simplified into smaller dimensions for ease of understanding and ability to solve by hand when given real numbers. Course material and lecturers could be a bit dry, but definitely nothing should be skipped (typically about 1-2 hours of lecture time). Overall, this allowed the student to effectively grasp the concepts with the homeworks, which were directly useful when it came to understanding the concepts presented.\n\nOn the subject of homeworks, there are 14 peer-graded homeworks (6501-style, 100/90/75/50/0) , mostly straightforward and relevant to the material presented in class for effective understanding reinforcement. Homeworks were mostly doable on paper, with a few homeworks to be done in Python but not requiring any more understanding than what was learned in CSE 6040. Homeworks took an average of 2-3 hours each, with some taking more but some taking less.\n\nExams could be a bit tricky, as there were questions that required deeper understanding than what was presented in class, and would not be explained until after the exam period. However, since most of the class missed the same questions for reasons of lack of coverage, it seemed to have been factored into the final course grade. The final grade was curved, where the cutoff for the Fall 2018 semester seems to have hovered around slightly above the class average. \n\nDefinitely recommended for reasons of usefulness and practical application...just be prepared for dry lectures and absentee professors (questions answered by 1-2 TAs).\n\n",

Yet, If I am posting a \"Strongly Disliked\" comment for Fall 2018, it means that the instructors does not care about any feedback which he clearly said on the forum -\"I don't care\". The forum is flooded with that statement for any question you ask. The course will teach you names of quite a few ML algorithms. You have to forget your social life to finish the assignments. But then at the end of the course you realize that the course didn't teach you any single algorithm at it's depth. The mathematics of the algorithms are hardly explained. The lecture is delivered through chaotic interaction between two profs who probably know their stuffs but does not know how to teach and too arrogant to take any feedback to improve. Waste of time but you have to take the course to be in ML specialization. Never seen more useless TAs who never help students with anything conclusive answers for any questions. All the students discussing stuffs and trying to find their ways. The only good part was the explanation of RL material at the end of the course. Clearly such courses/MS are not meant to teach you anything but just for business purpose. Similar feedback is posted for many other OMSCS ML specialization courses where the course is not being improved, the prof has left but the course keep on continuing. Take Andrew Ng courses on courser before taking this course so that you have an understating what the prof is talking about. Lower your expectation down from the course. If this is your first ML course, its okay but if you already have idea and looking for a deeper understanding , this is not going to help.   ",

            "text": "NOTE: I took the course in FALL 2018, but this wasn't available to select in the dropdown.\n\nThis course was a disappointment overall. The workload was challenging, but not for the right reasons. Most of the TAs were condescending and unhelpful. The regrading policy was draconian: If you asked for a regrade, but didn't get at least five points in the regrade, you would lose ten points (for failing to internalize criticism). \nThis would be fine, except that you have no access to the grading rubric, because... reasons. Additionally, grading was super-slow, with often a month elapsing between submitting a project and getting the grade back. This was particularly annoying when they missed getting an important grade back prior to the drop deadline. To make matters worse, approximately 2/3 of the way through the course, they \"clarified\" that you could ask questions about your grade without requesting a regrade. Presumably, they'd received complaints, but it struck me that this system was put in place to save the TAs from having to work, rather than for any benefit of the students.\n\nThe material is dated, and the lectures are very math heavy. The problem with that is that the math is presented as background material, and is poorly explained and has key details glossed over. Moreover, you don't actually need to know it for the course, and it's there at the expense of other explanations and more up-to-date material.\n\nOn top of that, two of the three projects require techniques that aren't mentioned at all (or are only barely touched upon) in the lectures. (Deep Learning and Linear Programming, respectively).\n\nThe projects are interesting, but more often than not, you are fumbling in the dark for solutions/hints that can only be found by searching the web, or watching David Silver's lectures.\n\nThis course needs a serious revamp. For one, the field has advanced a lot since the lectures were recorded. Secondly, the teaching style, was fairly adversarial. I get that it's supposed to challenge the students, but the challenge should come from the material, not from the attitudes of the professor and TAs. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this course. It was more difficult than it should have been, and for the wrong reasons. I want to feel like I'm being challenged to learn on a course, not condescended to. I was not the only one to feel this way.\n\nNote that I did well in this course, getting an A, so this is not just sour grapes on my part. This course has genuine problems. You should only take it if you *really* want to learn RL (outdated), and really don't mind being in the dark for most of the course. \n\nAn additional tip if you take this course: Watch David Silver's lectures in addition to the course lectures. They cover the material much more thoroughly and clearly.\n\nIn short, this course is a lot more work than it should be for the depth of material, and most of that time will be figuring out where to find missing information.",

The Professor difficulty suggestion is subjective. I found that the two most difficult project was assess_learners(rated challenging) and manual_strategy(rated moderate). Assess_learners was challenging because of the assignment itself while manual strategy was difficult because the instructions were general and supporting material was limited. I would recommend to start on each project as early as possible as there is usually minor changes when the assignment is finalize.\n\nExams were easy because one was similar to a prior exam and the second one was based on the top rated student question pools which you had access too.\n\nOverall, great course material of projects and lectures. Very clear expectations on most assignments, professor was active, and the Teaching Assistants were outstanding. Remember to check Piazza discussion and the Slack Channel as the staff was great. \n\n\n",

            "text": "Sorry, but this is a good course. Yes, the instructor holds the rubric private. That doesn't matter. Just answer all the questions asked in the assignment. Also address all the topics in the lecture and you'll definitely cover everything. Releasing a rubric would just further rob students of the work required to determine what sort of things it is important to report on. There are plenty of resources provided to help you.\n\nAnother common complaint is that the class is curved. I think we need to get over ourselves and not expect that getting less than 90% on an exam is a basis for panic and complaints to the instructor. The curve is more or less the same every single year both off campus and off.\n\nUltimately, this class delivers what it's supposed to deliver: a reasonable basis for evaluating algorithms and developing a sense of when one might perform better than another. This is an important skill and one you are unlikely to develop without taking a course like this or doing the same sort of work independently.\n\nIf you've gone through OMSCS complaining that the professor is absent, this is the course for you. The instructor is always there to remind you that he already answered the question in the assignment. The course doesn't change from semester to semester, and everything you need to excel is made available to you.\n\nA valid concern that some people bring up is that the course doesn't touch on newer topics. This is perhaps fair, but the course is already packed. Learn this stuff, and you can go take a deep-learning course after this with a strong foundation.\n\nIn general, try to know some math before taking this. That means linear algebra and calculus. If you take AI before, that might be helpful, but it really shouldn't be necessary. Additionally, you can take this course before RL, and that will be fine.",

You may get ideas about exams and homeworks from other reviews, so I just want to share my experience. I did not have a CS undergraduate and was a bit hesitate to take the class this fall 2018. I would say I learned a lot in this class and ended up with A (higher end) before the curve. To understand the material, I read DPV book and practiced the problems in the end of each chapter in addition to assigned homeworks. I feel like there are some typical dynamic programming problems you may be asked in the exams. Tried to understand all dynamic programming problems in lectures and the exam questions are just sort of the variants. They can restate the questions in different context or words but the approach to the problem sounds more similar. Material about graph algorithms is straightforward but I found the graph algorithm problems/questions are bit tricky. For exams, if you can not come up with good/optimal solutions, just write what you think and you may get some partial scores. You should try to get full points from homeworks and the project. The project is easy however you should follow instructions very carefully: what results they expect you to show in the report. I had to change the result figures several times following the piazza comments and got 100%. The final exam covers all materials ~3hours. I reviewed all lecture notes and practiced DP more in leetcode and had to watch additional videos to understand linear programming and NP-complete. These topics are kind of confusing for me. Some classmates found the NP/NP complete lectures from MIT courseware useful and you can try to watch them. If you have time to prepare , you can start with data structures and algorithms on coursera or MIT courseware. If not, just try to practice as much as possible throughout the class, tackle topic by topic and do not screw up any exams. You should not expect the curve because the instructor can change the grade policy each semester.  ",

            "text": "While I love the OMSCS program - it's hard to defend it and say it's on par with the on-campus program when students struggle with a class that is basically a very easy class to pass (get a B or better).\n\nWhat I mean by that is that I seriously don't know how you can fail this class.  You look at all these reviews and you think that Dynamic Programming is rocket surgery or something.  It is...for loops.... with arrays to store information.  That's it. \n\nFor Dynamic programming, each exam is divided into 4 parts of equal value.  You are given a problem that requires a for loop to solve.  You solve it this way.\n\nA) State the problem in words, (e.g. T[i,j] equals the maximum....\").  That's it.  You get free points.\n\nB) State the recursion.  This is the \"hard part\".  You place the stuff in for loop in here.  That's it. Don't forget the base case (e.g. the first loop iteration).  Here's where it gets tricky.\nIf you need a loop in the loop, you use \"for all\".  If you need to compare with a previous value in the loop, you use max/min.  And the trickiest part, sometimes, you have to include the current value (e.g. longest common subsequence problem(.  That's all there is to it.  These are explained in the lecture.  Just cross your t's and dot your i's, and you should be fine.\n\nC) Write your algorithm in psuedocode.  You know how to write two for loops and initialize a two-dimensional array, right?\n\nD) Count the loops within loops and that is is your O(n) value. For example, if you loop over n, and within that loop, you loop over n, your big O notation is O(n^2).  Free points.\n\nI'm not sure why people are doing tons of Dynamic Programming problems when, for the purpose of this class, it's just freakin' for loops.  And you do all of this in the homeworks already, so you know exactly what you have to put on the exam.\n\nLooking at the DP problem above, you are guaranteed 10/20 points.  And if you put something down, you'll get decent partial credit.  For example, there was one dynamic programming question that I did not know.  I got 12 out of 20 even though I forgot the base case and messed up the return in the psuedocode.  Now, let's put this in perspective - you needed a 60% to pass.  The homeworks and projects are free points (15% of your grade), so you really need like 53% to pass.  In the exams, I plain did not know 3 questions, and my grades were 11/20, 12/20, and 14/20 for those question because I just threw up something that resembled the homework.  You could literally pass this class and not get any real questions right in the exam. \n\nWhich makes me wonder how are people failing?  Are they writing Walking Dead fan fiction instead of answering the question? \n\nOther parts are easy - for the sake of brevity, I won't go into details like DP.  Divide and conquer is no more complex than something simple like quick sort.  Linear Programming is basically follow the same simple steps you did in the homework, and on and on.  FYI, make sure to memorize any formulas or major points in the slides for the multiple choice and true/false (yep, even though you need only 53% to pass, there's still true and false questions). \n\nI took my last algorithms class 20 years ago, so I should have put in more work than the average Joe.  But anyone who has taken any sort of halfway decent algorithm course should have seen 80%-90% of this and have worked less.  All the topics are pretty standard undergard fare.  And sorry, If you have never heard of NP-complete, then you really have no business in a Master's program. \n\nIn terms of time, homeworks should take you no more than a couple of hours (just look up the problem or a similar problem on stackexchange and put it as a reference).  No need to bang your head on something to gain some \"deep-seated knowledge\" when you just need to learn the steps once so you can repeat the same steps on the exam.  There's only 8 homeworks BTW.  The two midterms should take 5-10 hours each to study for, with the final exam taking 10. The project is actually really cool and I wish the whole class was like that instead of exam based.  That took about 7-8 hours to do. In other words, I have no idea how anyone could possibly spend the 20-30 hours a week on this class. \n\nOne quick note.  The first exam is the hardest, and there was no indication of a curve, (it was stated that you need a 65% to pass/get a B) so if someone got below the median, which was something like 65, it gave the impression that that person was failing, which caused a lot of people to drop unnecessarily.  \n\nAll in all though, this class is dirt easy.  I had no desire to really put in any effort into the class since it's a requirement I cared so little about.  I literally was too lazy and didn't bother studying certain items that were not well presented (e.g. roots of unity, Linear Programming Duality), because I knew it was impossible to fail this class.  Even with that, because of the generous curve at the end, I barely got an A.\n\nIt's sad that this class is presented as some sort of Boogie man when it should be viewed as the lightest course around (it was my lightest course).  No real programming, no complex math, simple tests that resemble the homeworks you were given.  It's about as straightforward as you can get.",

The lectures tend to skip over a lot of the details for how you get from step to step, which can be challenging if you don't have a pure math background. The lectures combined with the starter code give you enough to get through the course. the software wasn't super user-friendly, but they provide many examples, so you can figure it out easy enough. \nThe most frustrating thing about the course was the very slow feedback on assignments. I had no idea how i was doing because the grading was always a few assignments behind and there weren't really closed, verifiable answers. The professor jumped in on piazza a few times and was actually super helpful. TAs were ok. some of their comments were helpful, some not. I could never make office hours and the recordings were not really helpful. I think more user friendly software would make this class even better. I wanted to dig into some of the topics more, but i found myself lost unless I had starter code. I liked it overall.
